As regards the question of what happens if it subsequently crosses the boundary: once the umpire considers the to ball be under control, the dismissal takes place, which renders the ball dead under [23.1(iii)](http://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-23-dead-ball/). Once it's dead, what happens to the ball becomes irrelevant; the fielder could, in theory, throw it into the crowd (although I haven't seen that happen)."
