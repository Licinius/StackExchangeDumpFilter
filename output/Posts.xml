If&#10;  nothing else, this conclusion lends further credibility to the idea&#10;  that pitchers should almost always sacrifice if given the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=2851&quot;&gt;second part&lt;/a&gt; of his series, he notes:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, we need to consider that sacrificing is a strategy often&#10;  employed when getting one run is more important to winning than&#10;  scoring many.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;The values in Situation 3 immediately stand out. Virtually every major&#10;  leaguer is under those numbers; so, according to this model, it is&#10;  almost ALWAYS a good idea to sacrifice in that situation if only one&#10;  run is needed. This conclusion flies in the face of many of the&#10;  conventions usually espoused by performance analysts, but it is&#10;  supported by the raw numbers from the run probability table. Notice&#10;  that the probability of scoring at least one run increases from .635&#10;  to .693 when sacrificing in Situation 3.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Situation 3 is a man on 2nd with no outs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He concludes in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=2869&quot;&gt;part 3&lt;/a&gt; of the series:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, in the broadest conclusion possible, we can say that&#10;  sacrificing is a good idea when pitchers are batting and, for most of&#10;  the hitters in the league, when there is a man on second, no one out,&#10;  and a single run is the goal. Even then, there is a set of the&#10;  league's best hitters who should never lay down a bunt; which is too&#10;  bad, because it would be fun to see Bonds square around, just once.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the final conclusion that he draws is that a sacrifice bunt makes sense only in one situation: man on second, no one out, and a single run is the goal.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="61" LastActivityDate="2012-02-09T23:50:34.750" CommentCount="0"/>

As such, WAR can be used to compare players across different years and teams.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;WAR is derived from weighted runs above average, or the number of runs a player contributes through both his offense and defense above and beyond your typical &quot;replacement level&quot; player (i.e. waiver-wire pickup or the next guy in AAA). You divide the total offensive and defensive runs above average by 10 to arrive at wins. Note that these numbers are also adjusted by position since playing the catcher position is harder to play than playing right field.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Both Fangraphs (fWAR) and Baseball Reference (rWAR) use many of the same statistics to measure a player's offensive and defensive contributions, with the following differences: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;rWAR and fWAR both use FIP to measure a pitcher's performance, but rWAR also includes a pitcher's defensive runs saved as well.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;To measure a player's fielding capability, fWAR uses UZR, while rWAR uses TotalZone, two very similar defensive metrics.

If there's no reason to prevent the runner from advancing, the runner probably won't be trying to advance!  You normally see it when you have a baserunner hoping to keep a late rally (or potential rally) alive despite a big score differential; since it can prevent a game-ending double play it's not a terrible idea to get to second base, but if you still need to string together several hits to get back into the game, stealing second base isn't really going to affect the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The 10.07(g) Comment may be enlightening, and you may want to re-read it a couple times (it's pretty dense).

Even if they score the opposing team is going to have to score 4* more batters just to tie, and you'll have plenty of chances to turn those batters into outs.  In that case, the catcher that holds onto the ball after a pitch is truly indifferent: he doesn't care what the runner does, because the run can't hurt the team.  So the scorer should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; credit the runner with a stolen base, because there was no risk in attempting to advance to an undefended base.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;*except of course the runners-on-the-corners case, in which case they still need 3 batters to score.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="22" LastActivityDate="2012-03-22T20:58:06.517" CommentCount="5"/>

In an article about the imminent rule change in&#10;  The Chicago Tribune on Jan. 30, 1920, there is a headline that reads,&#10;  &#x201C;&lt;strong&gt;Cut Out the Joke Steals&lt;/strong&gt;.&#x201D; Hirdt called it a good rule because &lt;strong&gt;it&#10;  protects &#x201C;the spirit of what a stolen base is.&lt;/strong&gt;&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It seems that baseball's rule makers had a very strict definition of what a stolen base was - they did not want meaningless stat padding.

<row Id="748" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="745" CreationDate="2012-05-02T16:03:36.153" Score="4" Body="&lt;p&gt;I'll start with the why. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reason that there are so many Latin American baseball players is manifold. It's part socioeconomic, part lack of professional sports opportunities in their home countries and it's part the amount of money, time and effort various Major League Baseball (MLB) organizations have put into recruiting and signing Latin born players. Similar efforts are going on in Korea and other Asian countries, however they have not met with the same success, probably because there is not quite the same rich history of baseball tradition in those countries (although it's coming)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the socioeconomic/lack of pro-sports opportunity issue. In most places in Latin America, if you want to play pro sports you play soccer (futbol). It's the only major organized professional sport in several countries, and the only one besides baseball in most of the others. However, the salaries are not like professional sports in the US or Europe, and while they are a decent living, most truly amazing players in soccer or in baseball quickly find themselves whisked away to better competition in the US or Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;While Latin America is progressing economically, many of these countries have huge areas of poverty. For kids with athletic talent sports is a great way to get out of where you are and find a better life (same can be said of many low income folks in the US as well). Baseball, like soccer is an easy sport to find equipment for (you don't kneed a glove or a real bat, just a ball and a broom handle if you really want to play). With low barriers to entry it can become a fun game for kids to play in the street and they can get quite good.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Baseball teams have capitalized on this desire to make a better life, and the abundance of athletic children with limited opportunities in their home countries and have opened academies in several Latin American countries (Puerto Rico (I know Us territory, but still), the Dominican and Venezuela are the primary ones), and have begun recruiting kids at very young ages. Children as young as 16 may be signed by MLB teams. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Until the current Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) MLB has been fairly lax as to how much money these players can be given (the new CBA now has a pool of money that may be spent on international signings of players under 19). Because theses players do not have to go through a draft process they are free agents and may go to the highest bidder. Recent young Cuban defectors have signed for millions of dollars upfront.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the why, in my opinion, is a combination of lack of opportunities in their home countries, combined with a significant investment on the part of MLB teams and also the ability for teams to freely sign these players rather than force them through the draft (although this part is going away gradually).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally lets get some history. Obviously for the above to have happened there has to be some history here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Baseball came to Latin America in the late 1800s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_in_Cuba&quot;&gt;starting in Cuba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_in_Venezuela&quot;&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; shortly thereafter. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hispanicbaseballmuseum.com/exhibits/milestones/index.html&quot;&gt;Hispanic Baseball Museum&lt;/a&gt; Cubans have been playing in the United States since 1871. And the first Hispanic to play in the Major Leagues was Louis Castro in 1902. So we have well over 100 years of Hispanic players playing major league baseball and doing very well doing it. Significantly, black Latinos did not start playing in the Major Leagues until 1949.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;According to the timeline MLB clubs have been routinely recruiting in Latin America since Cincinnati around 1911. The first baseball academy in the Dominican did not &lt;a href=&quot;http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3974952&quot;&gt;open until 1973&lt;/a&gt; (although I suspect they opened in other places much earlier). There are numerous Hispanic Hall of Famers. And many more successful players that have not made it to the hall of fame. Based on this, and the fact that MLB teams continue to invest heavily in Latin America, it looks like MLB's investments in Latin America are both historic and seemingly well founded.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6" LastEditorUserId="6" LastEditDate="2012-05-04T13:49:26.243" LastActivityDate="2012-05-04T13:49:26.243" CommentCount="0"/>

Also, hitters can track and see a ball that is moving towards them better than away.  So for a lefty on lefty (or righty on righty) a 4 seam fastball tends to move slightly away (advantage pitcher) and both curveballs and sliders will break much further away (advantage pitcher).  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You'll notice that many of today's best left handed pitchers have developed excellent Change Ups (Johan Santana, Cole Hamels, and popularized by Tom Glavine).  Since there are far more right handed batters than left, they needed a pitch that would break away instead of towards the right handed hitters.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For pitchers who use primarily a fastball change-up it still makes a difference but it is not as exaggerated.  The 4 seem fastball should still be a tougher pitch for the left on left matchup.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The last thing is: everyone, both left and right handed hitters, see far fewer left handed pitchers throughout their careers.

If you can pay them a lower rate right now you have more money (and luxury tax room) available to surround your high dollar free agent with the talent needed to compete.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally there are plenty of reasons not to do this&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You end up paying a premium for past performance. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You end up chewing up a huge chunk of your payroll for a player that is well past his prime and cannot produce at the level his salary dictates&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The player becomes impossible to trade, and very difficult to release. Because contracts are guaranteed, the player is assured of seeing every dime of his contract regardless of whether he is playing or not, this means that making a case to ownership to release a player owed 18+ million at the end of his deal is very difficult (Alfonso Soriano is a great example of this).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can saddle a potentially competitive team with an albatross of a contract by serious limiting payroll flexibility if you manage to compete longer than your expected window.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All of this to say that backloading a contract is not always a negative, if you have a limited payroll and a limited window to compete then you might want to use a backloaded deal in order to be even more competitive than a balanced deal would allow you to be.

Exception 1, the starting pitcher must pitch at least 5 innings to be eligible for a win.&lt;br&gt;&#10;b. Exception 2, if a relief pitcher, who would normally be in line for a win, makes a &quot;brief appearance&quot; and is deemed ineffective, the official scorer can grant the win to the succeeding relief pitcher.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #1&lt;/strong&gt;:  The Cardinals are playing The Cubs in STL.  The Cards bat in the bottom of each inning.  The score is 0-0 until the bottom of the 7th inning in which the Cardinals score a run.  The game ends with the score 1-0.  The Cardinals pitcher that pitched the top half of the 7th inning would be the winning pitcher of record.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #1a&lt;/strong&gt;:  The Cardinals are playing the Cubs in STL.  At the end of 4 innings, the Cardinals are winning 9-8 in a slugfest.  The Cardinals swap out their starting pitcher with a long reliever and end up winning 9-8.  The Long Reliever would be the winning pitcher of record.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example #1b&lt;/strong&gt;:  The Cardinals are playing the Cubs in STL.  At the end of 6 innings, the score is 0-0.  In the top half of the 7th, with 2 outs, the Cardinals insert a reliever, he throws one pitch to get the final out.  In the bottom half, the Cardinals score a run.  In the top half of the 8th, the Cardinals insert a new reliever who pitches all of the 8th inning.  The Cardinals win 1-0.  The Official Scorer could decide that the reliever who pitched the 8th inning is the winning pitcher of record.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The losing pitcher is the pitcher who allows the go-ahead run to reach base for a lead that the winning team never relinquishes.

Your question is mildly flawed, since it is quoting the original rule.  The rule was changed in 1991 to not include games where 9 inning no-hitters were pitched, yet the game was still undecided (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-hitter&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;).

He then pitched two more outs before giving up a home run, losing the game and ending his no-hitter.  His 12 2/3 inning performance is sometimes attributed as the best performance by any pitcher in major league baseball history, especially considering the Braves' lineup at the time (&lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; Hank Aaron &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1917, the Reds' &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Toney&quot;&gt;Fred Toney&lt;/a&gt; and the Cubs' &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippo_Vaughn&quot;&gt;Hippo Vaughn&lt;/a&gt; both pitched 9 innings of no-hit baseball.  In the top of the tenth, the Reds scored a run on a few hits, and Toney came back in the bottom of the inning to complete his 10-inning complete game no hitter, whereas Vaughn dealt with his loss after pitching 9 1/3 innings of a no-hitter.  This is the only time in major league history that there were no hits by either team in 9 innings of baseball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Maloney&quot;&gt;Jim Maloney&lt;/a&gt; of the Reds pitched 10 innings of no-hit ball in 1965 against the New York Mets.  Johnny Lewis hit a home run to lead off the eleventh, and Maloney lost the game.  Incidentally, he also pitched 9 innings of a no-hitter two months later, except he won in the tenth inning (the first time a pitcher scored a no-hitter in more than 9 innings).  Maloney has a very interesting no-hitter repertoire that I won't go into here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="503" LastActivityDate="2012-05-29T19:18:17.333" CommentCount="11"/>

Many players will skip one or several of the following levels of the minor leagues.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For college pitchers, often the first thing they must do is finish their current collegiate seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are the possible levels of professional baseball in most major league organizations:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extended Spring Training - A short season league with very lax rules where players can work on things and get extra reps before either being assigned to a minor league team, or get some work before taking a break before fall baseball).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short Season A ball- Often the first stop for prospects, this is usually a short season league that plays part of the summer. Gets kids ready to play professional baseball with a season that is only slightly longer than the typical college season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fall ball - Played in Arizona, the fall league is where a lot of guys in the minors go after either a short season and some rest, or after a full minor league season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low A ball - Often the first stop for a new professional ball player. This is where they get to cut their teeth and face other professionals for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;High A ball - Advanced players will sometimes start here, but it's often the second half of year one, or year two for players who do all right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Double A - It's rare for a player to start at double A and most players here have been in their club's system for a year or two. There are some veterans around who have been playing minor league ball for a few years and likely aren't going to make it past this level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Triple A - This level is a mix of young guys who are close to the big leagues, old guys looking for new life and the so called AAAA players, guys who might get a short callup but are likely to spend the rest of their careers bouncing around AAA farm clubs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winter League ball - This is a place where guys can get extra work. It's most often played in Latin America and the Caribbean Isles where it's warm enough in the off season to still play. Guys will head down if they need extra work, just love playing and can't get enough, or for any other reason. These are the professional leagues in these countries so they are filled with guys who either were discovered too late to come to the US and play in the big leagues, or who weren't quite good enough to get signed. MLB players who come here will often only play in a handful of games, just whatever they need to get the extra work they require&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Leagues - This is the end goal, what players often work between 2 and 5 years to get to. Once they are here they finally start making the money they dreamed of and can play baseball at the highest level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a long road to get from the draft to the major leagues, excellent players often shortcut one or many levels of their team's farm system, but most players play for at least part of one season in the minor leagues (the last player to go straight to the bigs from the draft was Mike Leake in Cincinnati a couple of years ago)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6" LastEditorUserId="6" LastEditDate="2012-06-05T12:59:29.670" LastActivityDate="2012-06-05T12:59:29.670" CommentCount="0"/>

This is a really bad situation; if it's been a pitcher's duel all night and the score is only 1-0, your pitcher, typically your worst batter, is your last hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team, statistically, gets an average of 9.27 hits in a game.

Read up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_%28baseball%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, but essentially, #1 should be the best baserunner (including stolen base percentage) and have a good OBP made up primarily of hits. #2 should be able to get on base by any means necessary, and failing that should be able to make the sacrifice to advance a runner. #3 should be good at RBIs and second-best OBP. These guys' job is to &quot;warm it up&quot; for the cleanup hitter, #4; this should typically be your slugger, the best batting average with runners in scoring position, highest home run count, the works. #5 and #6 are your best RBI men (to bring home the &quot;heart of the order&quot; when they get on base); their OBP is typically driven by home runs and sacrifice hits. 7 and 8 are where you stick the weaker players, with 8 being the traditional slot for the worst fielder. The 9th slot varies; in the AL, where the pitcher doesn't bat, this spot's typically filled by the guy you'd use as your #1 if you didn't have the guy you put in #1; he's a &quot;second leadoff hitter&quot; designed to get a good baserunner on base for the top of the order. In the NL, #9 is traditionally the pitcher's slot, though if your team is hitting well, you can arrange your lineup similarly to the AL and put a &quot;second leadoff&quot; into the #9 slot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="528" LastEditorUserId="528" LastEditDate="2012-06-11T21:25:17.363" LastActivityDate="2012-06-11T21:25:17.363" CommentCount="5"/>

<row Id="997" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="996" CreationDate="2012-06-20T20:54:40.853" Score="3" Body="&lt;p&gt;A normal BABIP for a pitcher is around.300.  It's possible due to exceptionally poor, or exceptionally good defense that &quot;normal&quot; could be anywhere from .290 - .310.  So anywhere within that spread should be considered somewhat normal.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What a high BABIP tells us is that a pitcher is unlucky.  It tells us this because we are generalizing that once a ball is put into play (notice strikeouts, homeruns, sac flies and walks do not count) the pitcher has no effect on whether that ball is a hit or an out.  If the average ball in play goes for a hit at a .300 rate, but pitcher A has a BABIP of .370, it's telling us that this pitcher should regress towards the mean.  So if the pitcher does regress towards the mean, we would expect other stats like ERA or WHIP to come down as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, a low BABIP tells us that a pitcher has been lucky that more balls hit in play did not go for hits.  So we can look at a pitcher with a .250 BABIP and expect that his other stats may be going up as well as he regresses towards the mean.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now it's certainly not full proof and doesn't take into account fly ball/ground ball rates etc... But used with other advanced statistics, it can tell you quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BABIP can also be used for hitters, however it is not quite as helpful.  While it can be generally said that once a ball is in play, a pitcher has little influence over whether or not that ball is a hit, it can't be said for hitters.  This is mostly due to speed, where faster hitters are more likely to effect their BABIP due to running out infield singles.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="342" LastActivityDate="2012-06-20T20:54:40.853" CommentCount="0"/>

The formula/definition that you mention above is a good indicator of what it measures - the percentage of hits for balls that were hit into play. Per this &lt;a href=&quot;http://sports.espn.go.com/fantasy/baseball/flb/story?page=mlbdk2k11babipprimer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;excerpt&lt;/a&gt; from ESPN:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;BABIP, or batting average on balls in play, was originally designed to&#10;  measure a pitcher's ability to prevent hits on balls in play. Today&#10;  it's widely used to evaluate both pitchers and hitters, and it's a&#10;  calculation of a hitter's batting average -- or pitcher's batting&#10;  average allowed -- on batted balls put into the field of play. That&#10;  means walks and strikeouts don't count; those aren't batted balls. Nor&#10;  do home runs; those don't land within the field of play.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For pitchers, some analysts view a low BABIP as an indicator that the pitcher has been &quot;lucky,&quot; since they believe that pitchers have little control over balls that are hit in play. In this type of analysis, pitchers that have lower BABIP that their historic averages are viewed as being likely to perform worse in the future, as their BABIP should revert to the mean/norms. However, pitchers might have consistently higher/lower BABIP due to their styles (e.g., percentage of ground balls vs flyballs) and the quality of their fielders.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, this metric can be used to measure the &quot;luck&quot; of hitters - a higher than normal BABIP may indicate that a hitter will &quot;cool off&quot; over the course of the season, while a hitter that has a low BABIP will tend &quot;heat up&quot; as the season progresses. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As the ESPN article notes, there are several additional factors that impact BABIP - speed of the hitter, quality of contact, and the quality of the defense. As an example, hitters will a good hitting eye may have better quality of contact and have better BABIP rates than their peers. Faster hitters might also be able to beat out throws to first, thus increasing their BABIP.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="61" LastActivityDate="2012-06-20T20:55:05.897" CommentCount="0"/>

It, along with unions and some other legal maneuvering are required in order to escape anti-trust regulations that are set up by the United States Congress to promote competition and limit monopolies. Because Sport Leagues are functionally monopolies there are special protections in place so that they can exist (primarily CBAs and Unions for players, coaches and officials) without serious legal repercussions. When players and owners cannot come to terms on a CBA you see the kind of legal maneuvering that the NFL and their players' association participated in last summer.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Baseball just signed a brand new collective bargaining agreement before this current season that is good for a number of years.

However,&#10;  sometimes when a pitcher loses his feel and the mechanics start to&#10;  break down.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;So watch the pitcher, and listen to the scouting report. He probably&#10;  only has 3-4 pitches he throws as a starter, and 2-3 as a reliever.&lt;br&gt;&#10;  Normally it will be a choice of Fastball, Slider, Cutter, Splitter,&#10;  Sinker or a Knuckleball. There are more but these are rare.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;Once the pitch has been released and is in flight, here are some ways&#10;  to distinguish a pitch (assuming a right-handed pitcher, which you can&#10;  most likely invert for a lefty):  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;ul&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fastball&lt;/strong&gt; - Very little break. Fast. Pretty easy to tell when someone throws a fastball.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slider&lt;/strong&gt; - This is slower than a fastball but with a similar release, Small to Med break. The best will break sharply and late,&#10;  they will have a drop as well as a slide to them. Hanging sliders will&#10;  look like a slower fastball with very little and often early to mid&#10;  break.   Sliders are common pitches(&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Johnson#Pitching_style&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Randy Johnson&lt;/a&gt; had a pretty&#10;  famous one) and sort of like faster curveballs, but are easy to &quot;hang&quot;&#10;  by the pitcher, where the at the wrong velocity, can just sit up for&#10;  the batter to crush.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cutter&lt;/strong&gt; - Will maintain horizontal plane and cut away from a right-handed batter, sometimes picking up velocity. Very few pitchers&#10;  can throw this pitch well, which is why &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariano_Rivera#Pitching_style&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Mariano Rivera&lt;/a&gt;'s career&#10;  is so remarkable.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Splitter&lt;/strong&gt; - There is a giveaway in the arm release because it's usually &quot;over the ear&quot; and supposed to look like a fastball, but right&#10;  at the plate, it's supposed to bottom-out.   Normally if a pitcher&#10;  throws a splitter the camera will always be focusing on his grip. They&#10;  will show his fingers split really far apart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sinker&lt;/strong&gt; - This is a kind of pitch that is in-between a fastball and a split-finger fasterball. It is meant to be a fast pitch that&#10;  &quot;drives down&quot; very hard as it approaches the plate. It's popular&#10;  because sinkers increase the likelihood that a batter, on contact,&#10;  will drive the ball into the ground, and ground-ball pitchers are less&#10;  likely to be scored on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knuckleball&lt;/strong&gt; - Most obvious pitch of all. Tumbles instead of rotates, goes about 50-70 mph, and normally pitchers dedicated to it&#10;  are the only ones to throw it. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Wakefield#Pitching_style&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tim Wakefield&lt;/a&gt; is famous for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;Look at the following diagram that shows the ball movement and break&#10;  (For right handed pitcher)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/7ruJ2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;baseball pitches&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quora.com/Baseball/How-do-you-visually-identify-the-different-types-of-baseball-pitches&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#10;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lokeshdhakar.com/baseball-pitches-illustrated/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="385" LastEditorUserId="11943" LastEditDate="2016-08-18T00:23:32.587" LastActivityDate="2016-08-18T00:23:32.587" CommentCount="1"/>

Your better pitchers have a number of weapons to accomplish this, but key to all of them is control over three elements of the pitch; speed (and thus timing), vertical axis (drop), and horizontal axis (slide).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;From the very good diagram Dor linked to, here's a basic breakdown of the most common RHP's pitches as seen by a RHB:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast Pitches&lt;/strong&gt; (usually 85mph+ in the major leagues):&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Break&lt;/strong&gt; - Four-Seam Fastball (speed is usually mid to high 90s, can exceed 100, and will appear to head pretty directly to the plate)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaks Low&lt;/strong&gt; - Splitter (speed's in the high 80s to low 90s, designed to look like a fastball but takes a dive under the bat; giveaway is a &quot;snappy&quot;, compact delivery with the pitcher's index and middle fingers split severely)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaks Inside&lt;/strong&gt; - Two-Seam Fastball/Sinker (again, speed in the high 80s/low 90s, designed to look like a fastball but breaks towards a RHB to jam him up)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaks Outside&lt;/strong&gt; - Cutter (speed in the low 90s, breaks outside without dropping to look like a four-seam fastball, notorious for breaking bats, difficult to throw correctly and so rare)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaks Outside Low&lt;/strong&gt; - Slider (Speed high 80s low 90s, breaks outside and drops to make the batter &quot;chase&quot; what he thought was a four-seam; more often seen than the cutter)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Off-speed pitches&lt;/strong&gt; (between 70-85mph)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Break&lt;/strong&gt; - Change-up (designed to throw off a batter's timing, looks like a fastball and goes right down the middle, but speed can be as low as 70mph, but more likely high 70s-low 80s)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaks Low&lt;/strong&gt; - Forkball (slightly faster than most other off-speed pitches, usually mid-80s, it's quite literally a slow splitter)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaks Very Low&lt;/strong&gt; - Curveball (changes everything about the batter's approach, looks like a change-up but dives under the bat. Sometimes incorrectly called a changeup, but the vertical curve is more pronounced. Thrown incorrectly, it doesn't dive, and coupled with the slower speed it's a batter's dream pitch)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaks Inside&lt;/strong&gt; - Circle Changeup (Simple variation of the changeup, looks like a change-up but breaks inside much like a two-seam does in the fast pitches)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaks Inside Low&lt;/strong&gt; - Screwball (difficult and rare, it looks like a curveball coming in but breaks inside)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaks Outside Low&lt;/strong&gt; - Slurve (combination slider/curve, looks like a curveball but breaks outside like a slider)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The variation of speed and breaking action produces a host of possibilities, which a good battery can use to keep the batter guessing. A pitcher can also aim pitches differently to make them look like other pitches; a pitcher can throw a fastball high and fool the batter into thinking it was going to be a sinker or splitter, or can throw a two-seam wide and the batter may think it's an errant four-seam until it breaks back over the plate. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Batters like a variety of different pitches; exactly what the batter likes should be known by the pitcher and/or catcher, and a combination of what the batter flat doesn't like, and pitches that look like what he does like but then change, are generally the order of the day. From time to time a pitcher may give a batter exactly what he wants, hopefully when he's least expecting it; this is often necessary to avoid showing the batter the same pitch too many times, and a missed opportunity can also put the batter &quot;on the tilt&quot;, throwing off their concentration as they mentally kick themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="528" LastEditorUserId="528" LastEditDate="2012-07-30T15:34:09.703" LastActivityDate="2012-07-30T15:34:09.703" CommentCount="0"/>

More specialists. More substitutions.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;NL President Chub Feeney thought that the change to baseball strategy would take away entertaining moments of the game&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There were personal player objections to the change. For example, Jim Palmer (pitcher for the Orioles), felt that he wouldn't be as big a part of the game sitting in the dugout. Hank Aaron thought that as a DH, one wouldn't have the opportunity to redeem oneself on the defensive side of the ball if he struck out.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Later, in 1984, the MLB Commissioner polled fans and learned that AL fans favored the DH rule, but NL fans opposed it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The analysis by Buehler and Calandrillo goes further, including a discussion of moral hazard, and how the DH rule changes the cost-benefit of pitching inside, increasing the number of hit batters in the AL.

If nothing else, this mindset helps one watch the pitch all the way into the glove.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the call is a strike, one should rise from the slightly crouched stance, raise the right hand into a fist and pump it forward with authority and confidence while calling out 'HIKE'.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why 'HIKE' and not 'STRIKE'?  Simple, it's easier to call (especially for 7, 8, 9, or more innings), and it sounds close to the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The main point is to both call and signal the strike with authority.  Oh, and swinging strikes are signaled, but not called out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In addition, we're taught to make all strike calls, including strike three, where we're allowed a little bit of showmanship, while facing forward &#x2013; not looking to the right.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why?  Well, home plate umpires in MLB, and I believe umpires in AAA along with umpires working certain special games, are the few who have the luxury of having another umpire on &lt;em&gt;each&lt;/em&gt; of the bases.  In the lower minor leagues, I believe there are typically only two base umpires, and in much, if not all, of amateur baseball, there are typically only two umpires total, one home plate ump, and one base ump who moves around the diamond depending on the number and position of runners on base.  (Unfortunately, sometimes one umpire is unlucky enough to have his partner not show up, and he's force to make all the calls.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the call is a ball, one should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; rise and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; signal in any way &#x2013; calling &quot;ball&quot; with authority, but usually not as much volume.  At the amateur level, the call should be loud enough for the pitcher to hear it.  Obviously, that goal becomes more difficult the larger the crowd is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a final note, remember that this is what we're &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;taught&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  Once out of the classroom, personal style will naturally change some things.  However, if one tries to be too much of a showman, it could degrade one's performance in the eyes of the coaches who submit the umpire game reports, which results in one being a showboat umpire in Little League (no offense meant to Little League umps &#x2013; I've been one &#x2013; I'm just saying that a poorly graded/ranked umpire won't even earn a chance to work Varsity HS games, much less move on to college games and beyond).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;While this may not have answered the original question, I hope the insight is useful and/or enlightening.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="423" LastActivityDate="2012-08-16T03:53:07.620" CommentCount="4"/>

Finally in 1893, the pitcher's box was removed, but&#10;  the pitcher's plate, or rubber, was introduced and moved back an&#10;  additional five feet. That gave us today's 60 feet 6 inches.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;With an official diameter of 18 feet, and rising to 10 inches above&#10;  the level field, the pitcher's mound, or hill, has been a part of&#10;  baseball since around the turn of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The elevation on pitcher's mound was made in order to return some advantages to pitchers that was lost due to extending the pitcher position.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;By elevating their delivery point, pitchers can gain momentum as they&#10;  stride down towards the plate. This forward motion adds speed and a&#10;  downward angle to the ball, making it more difficult to hit.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;off course there are another speculations like this one:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;That the mounds evolved as a matter of&#10;  grounds-keeping practice, for better drainage and water absorption. &#10;  After overhand pitching was legislated in 1884, pitchers undoubtedly&#10;  found the mounds to be an advantage: the downward weight-shift and&#10;  momentum enable them to generate greater velocity on their pitches.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;as you stated in the question &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;The pitcher&#x2019;s plate shall be 10 inches above the level of home plate.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But this was not always true:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;During different periods in baseball history, the mound has been much&#10;  taller.  The mound in Philadelphia's Shibe park was rumored to be 20&quot;&#10;  high at one time, and the mound throughout baseball in the late 60s&#10;  was as high as 16&quot;.  It wasn't until 1969 that it was lowered to&#10;  today's standard.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;According to baseball historian Bill Deane:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;the idea for a mound was claimed by an 1880s pitcher, John Montgomery&#10;  Ward. From 1903 to 1968, baseball rules limited the height of the&#10;  mound to 15 inches, although several groundskeepers were rumored to&#10;  have added an inch or two depending on the state of their team's&#10;  pitching.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;Over the years, as pitchers grew bigger and stronger, hitting&#10;  declined. Major League Baseball knew that most fans would rather see&#10;  home runs than shutouts, so the mound was lowered to ten inches in&#10;  1969. The adjustment worked &#x2013; team batting averages jumped up about 15 points.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sources: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lifeslittlemysteries.com/657-why-is-there-a-pitchers-mound-in-baseball.html&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.allexperts.com/q/Baseball-Trivia-General-2552/Pitcher-mound.htm&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="385" LastActivityDate="2012-09-11T22:54:27.427" CommentCount="1"/>

That's why batters switch hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-five percent of players are left-handed, where in real life only 10 percent [of people] are left-handed, so that's proof that they&#10;  are two-and-a-half-times better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;left-handed batter is closer to first base, so he's got a couple steps&#10;  advantage trying to beat out a grounder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Batters mostly have learned from right-handed pitchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Second one is that Left-handed pitchers have an advantage over left handed batters&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This isn't related to Left-handed but referring to the fact that pitcher has an advantage over batter who bat with the same hand, The claim is that:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;This is because a right-handed pitcher's curveball breaks to the left,&#10;  from his own point of view, which causes it to cross the plate with&#10;  its lateral movement away from a right-handed batter but towards a&#10;  left-handed batter (and vice-versa for a left-handed pitcher), and&#10;  because batters generally find it easier to hit a ball that is over&#10;  the plate.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So according to the above the answer is &lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sources: &lt;a href=&quot;http://tokyoswallows.com/2008/07/14/left-handed-baseball-players-have-advantage/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-handed_specialist&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/07/18/southpaw-s-revenge.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/sb20080711a1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.wustl.edu/news/Pages/11980.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070629115319AALSYf4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="385" LastActivityDate="2012-09-19T15:08:21.360" CommentCount="1"/>

Even for booth reviews in football, the replay must show that the call was clearly wrong in order for it to be reversed (and that aspect of the ref's on-field ruling must be reversible; you can't, for instance, assert that a penalty should have been called when there wasn't one).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That said, most major leagues have adopted some sort of &quot;appeals process&quot;, both in game and after the game is over.

Matt's application of rule 7.08e is correct; once the force is removed by tagging out the batter (the following runner), R1 is safe on either first or second and is not required to advance. It's a tricky situation all around, but R1 basically made the right call by standing on first; 1B would have to both muff the catch and let the batter reach on error to force R1 to advance to second. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If R1 had left the base and headed to second, that opens up a couple of DP scenarios; 1B could have caught the ball and tagged R1 returning to first, or could have muffed, tagged the batter, then thrown to second for a tagout or pickling of R1. If the basemen have some real cannons or the batter had given up halfway to first, 1B could have made it a force play at second and then forced out the batter back at first, but in amateur baseball pretty much any other scenario is more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="528" LastEditorUserId="528" LastEditDate="2013-04-10T18:31:29.330" LastActivityDate="2013-04-10T18:31:29.330" CommentCount="0"/>

Examples are &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Fastabll&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Changeup&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Slider&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Curveball&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Cut Fastball&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Kunckleball&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The break and speed of these pitches vary quite dramatically so it's important for the catcher to know what's coming.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reason that a pitcher has so many pitches is so that he can vary the speed, rotation, location and break to the batter. If the batter knows what pitch is coming they can largely negate the advantage that the pitcher creates by being able to mix their pitches.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Generally you want signs to be simple between a pitcher and a catcher. This is due to the fact that miscommunication with signals can lead to passed balls, wild pitches and even injury to the catcher. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This means that most of the time it makes sense for the catcher and pitcher to communicate via a simple system. The catcher shows the sign between his legs and the pitcher either nods to accept the sign or shakes his head to tell the catcher to change pitches. Then the catcher places his glove in the intended location and that becomes the target location for the pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, this is not the whole story. The catcher is generally &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; just calling pitches. Generally pitch selection is either the result of prior planning and discussion with the pitcher (they will generally meet before a game to work on how to get specific hitters out). Or the pitches are relayed by the manager or pitching coach from the dugout to the catcher and then to the pitcher. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some specific situations where this system changes:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When a runner reaches second base the catcher will almost always go to the mound to tell the pitcher that he will be switching to a more complicated signally system so that the runner (who has full view of his signalling) has a harder time determining the signs and cannot relay information to the batter)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In late and close games with runners on base you might see the catcher go to the mound every pitch or every couple of pitches. This is because the margin for error is very slim and they want to avoid any potential confusion due to signals getting crossed.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This mostly applies to starting pitchers. When a reliever enters the game usually they throw fewer pitches (some great ones only have a single pitch, see Mariano Rivera with the cut fastball), and they will likely not have as well developed of a gameplan with their catcher. This is where having a veteran catcher who knows a pitcher very well is really important. He potentially knows the hitters better than the pitcher does and is the guide for the reliever to get outs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6" LastActivityDate="2013-08-26T15:41:20.793" CommentCount="4"/>

The average BABIP given up by a pitcher is something like .300. Most batters have averages below .300 because they strike out a lot. That gives them fewer chances to apply that &quot;.300&quot; average to balls in play, while the strikeouts are in the denominator of the batting average. On the other hand, home runs are &quot;free&quot; hits that do not count in the BABIP calculation, but does improve the batting average.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The assumption of a .300 BABIP is also critical in computing pitchers' field independent pitching statistics (FIP). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The formula is 3.00 +(13*HR+ 3*Walks-2*KO)/IP, with the &quot;constant&quot; 3.00 assuming a .300 BABIP.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That is, if a pitcher gave up no home runs and no walks, and struck out no one, his ERA would be 3.00, because there would be about 12 hits (and 27 outs) in a game, yielding three runs (on average).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All other things being equal, strikeouts reduce a pitcher's ERA, because there are fewer contacted balls to hit.

While there are specific guidelines, some umpires change it a little based on the height or size of the batter. Most of the time, batters swing at these pitches because from the pitchers windup, they thing it will be a strike. They follow the ball usually as it passes the ear of the pitcher (left for a southpaw and right for a righty) Some pitches such as a slider, fake the batter out by appearing to come down the plate, but fall lower than anticipated, hence the name. A change up or off speed pitch do the same to a batter from their view. They believe that they will cross the plate in the strike zone, therefore they take a whack at it but often whiff if they don't realize the style of pitch.

There have been various theories to account for this, including the impact of fan support, and possible &quot;home team&quot; bias by umpires.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there may be a more tangible home team advantage called the &quot;principle of last action.&quot; This advantage derives from the fact that the home team bats and score last in every inning, and in the game itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In poker, there is a large advantage to being last, and seeing what other people have done. For instance, if you are &quot;last&quot; with a mediocre hand, and have observed other people betting timidly (or not at all), you might bet to steal the pot. If others have &quot;raised&quot; each others' bets, you might &quot;fold&quot; and let the stronger hands fight it out. If you were first to go with the same, mediocre hand, you would have to bet (or not) without knowing what others wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in the ninth, and all the extra innings, if the home team ever takes the lead, the visiting team will not have a &quot;return&quot; opportunity in a subsequent inning.

On the other hand, if the visiting team has a one run lead in the top of the ninth, it must wonder, is that enough? Can we save the bench for tomorrow, or do we need to &quot;pile on,&quot; now?

Cubs vs Pirates, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fangraphs.com/wins.aspx?date=2014-03-31&amp;amp;team=Pirates&amp;amp;dh=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;opening day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We can see in this game, that starting in the first inning, the home team had about a 4 percentage point better odds in the middle of the inning then they did at the beginning of it. This increased as the game continued until the 9th and 10th innings where the odds are 11.4 percentage points higher. However, it's worth noting that at the &lt;em&gt;top&lt;/em&gt; of each inning the odds are 50-50. When both teams have equal numbers of at-bats remaining, the odds are about the same when the score is tied at 0.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's look at one more situation. Let's look at a one run lead going into the 9th inning. We'll need to examine two games for this one. In the first game, the home team is up one to begin the 9th. We'll use this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fangraphs.com/plays.aspx?date=2014-03-31&amp;amp;team=Orioles&amp;amp;dh=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Orioles vs Redsox&lt;/a&gt; game also from opening day. The odds of the Orioles winning was 83.3. Contrast this to the odds of the Away team winning a 1 run game in the 9th. For that we'll use this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fangraphs.com/wins.aspx?date=2014-04-04&amp;amp;team=Nationals&amp;amp;dh=0&amp;amp;season=2014&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Braves vs Nationals&lt;/a&gt; game. Looking at the odds going into the top of the 9th, we see that the Braves had a 84.9% chance of winning it, but after going hitless in their final at-bat, their odds of winning were only 81.6%. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The contrast to note here is the 1.7 percentage point difference going into the last at-bat for the losing team. When the home team has another at-bat it makes a difference nearly 2% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Obviously these two examples don't account for the full home field advantage, but the fangraphs data does show a clear edge for the home team historically due to last action.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6" LastActivityDate="2014-04-10T17:30:46.547" CommentCount="2"/>

Consider this scenario: Runner on first, one out.  Batter hits a sharp ground ball to second base, runner on first is heading to second but stops short of the second baseman who is attempting to make a tag.  Second baseman decides to throw to first to force the batter, then hoping to get runner in a rundown since he's still closer to first base than to second base.  Right about the same time the ball arrives at the bag from the second baseman to force the batter at first, the runner on first gets the bright idea to head back to first to try to slide under the tag of the first baseman.  If he gets back to the bag safely, he is safe.  So now there are two outs with a runner on first, namely, the original runner on first who was off the bag but got back safely after the force on the batter was made.

Thus, one would not be &quot;squeezing&quot; in a run if a bunt was used to advance base runners &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; on third base. A bunt with the intention of advancing a base runner (regardless of whether the batter gets on base or not) is known as a &quot;sacrifice bunt.&quot; A &quot;squeeze bunt&quot; is a type of &quot;sacrifice bunt.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;hr&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;Or is it a special type of bunt (e.g. toward the first base line) to maximize the chances of the runner getting from third to home?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the different types of squeeze bunts, the player has the discretion on whether to take his chances, before or during a bunt, to advance home. The placement of the bunt, although a significant factor, does not seem to define a &quot;squeeze bunt&quot; as such. A &quot;squeeze bunt&quot; is defined as such if the overall intention is to advance the base runner from third base.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are two different kinds of &quot;squeeze bunts&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Safety: The base runner on third base determines when and if to run based on where the ball is bunted. The main factor is the probability of the fielding team able to throw out the base runner at home plate, and this may be further determined by defensive fielding alignment (eg, are the infielders aligned closer to home plate than usual?).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Suicide: The base runner on third base advances for home immediately after the pitch is thrown.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;" OwnerDisplayName="user527" LastEditorDisplayName="user527" LastEditDate="2014-05-01T18:20:41.420" LastActivityDate="2014-05-01T18:20:41.420" CommentCount="1"/>

If this is not the case and there is a delay in the action, ie between pitches the batter may step out (in the comments part of 6.02 b).  Also the batter is allowed to take time to receive signs from the coach.

In the MLB there is little to no concern over pace of play. It is rare to see an umpire warn a batter for taking his time between pitches.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing to consider about baseball is most calls are judgement calls.  The rule book is vague.  Things from the strike zone to what constitutes a delay are at the umpires discretion.  The MLB ran into this earlier in 2014 with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2014/04/25/mlb-clarifies-transfer-rule/8152737/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;transfer&quot; rule (2.0)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The are no penalties or fouls in baseball so it is often understood that umpires are seen as moderators instead of officials.  If teams play slow, they play slow and vice verse for fast paced teams.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Yankees and Red Sox are notorious for playing slow, and when they meet up games may exceed 4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In lower levels there is much more emphasis on this rule. Often at the high school levels and below, hitters are asked to keep one foot in the box while receiving signs from the coach.  In college (NCAA) there is a time limit or &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703559604576174813158261654&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;pitch clock&lt;/a&gt; between innings and pitches.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="2157" LastActivityDate="2014-05-22T20:41:59.270" CommentCount="0"/>

A good example of this is the LA Dodgers pitching staff.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=425844#gameType=%27R%27&amp;amp;sectionType=career&amp;amp;statType=2&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;level=%27ALL%27&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Zack Greinke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=477132#gameType=%27R%27&amp;amp;sectionType=career&amp;amp;statType=2&amp;amp;season=2014&amp;amp;level=%27ALL%27&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Clayton Kershaw&lt;/a&gt; are both seen as aces on the same staff, even though Kershaw was the number 1 starter to being the season and Greinke was the number 2.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As far as seeing a pitcher as dominant, it changes from person to person and team to team.

There is a large minor league system for development.  Many pitchers may be valued at a young age because of the potential, but don't end up panning out.  Some pitchers may become an ace for a short period of time due to age, injury, or any other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="2157" LastActivityDate="2014-06-02T16:44:53.890" CommentCount="0"/>

Pretty much every shot in tennis has some kind of spin on it - the serve, ground strokes (both topspin and slice), volleys, drop shots, etc. They all have spin. It is not really something to try and get good at anyway, because it would mean the easiest kind of shot possible for your opponent to return (a ball with no spin poses no challenges to the player trying to hit the ball, unlike a ball with a certain amount of spin/pace).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The shots where the ball changes direction after hitting the ground is when the player hits a slice and puts a sideways spin on the ball so that after it hits the ground, it will go in the direction of the spin.

The A's have the highest run differential of any team this year by quite a margin - it's roughly twice that of the next team.

A pitcher could switch with an outfielder and then switch back for the next batter.  The only difference between switching between a pitcher and a position player is that a pitcher must face a batter (unless he becomes injured during the at bat).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In your scenario, the outfielder could come in to pitch and the pitcher could go to the outfield.  The next batter, or next inning they could switch back.  There is no required substitution in this situation.  It often happens late in games with limited bench players renaming.  A left handed pitcher may be brought in to face one batter, and instead of burning an extra pitcher in the process, the current pitcher is placed in the outfield for a batter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This scenario happened to the Atlanta Braves.  You can see in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ATL/ATL200804030.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;box score&lt;/a&gt;, Chris Resop (a pitcher) comes in to pitch, then moves to left field, and then back to pitcher.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As to your question about &quot;swing men&quot;, the basic answer is no.  There are many position players with good arms.  There are many problems with this though.  First of all it takes a lot of time and practice to even make it to the big leagues.  This is spent on hitting or pitching, and not both.  A position player may be able to throw as hard or harder than some pitchers, but it does not mean he can throw strikes, locate pitches, hold runners, etc.  Some players that struggle hitting in the big leagues will go back to the minor leagues and convert to a pitcher.  This again takes time to perfect.  The other issue with &quot;swing men&quot; is that there is an organization of 100+ players, and to have a position player that is better than those pitchers is pretty rare.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;swing players&quot; you refer to would be called a two way player in baseball.  In college baseball it is much more common.  The players may also DH for them selves as they pitch (a quirky NCAA rule).  The award for that specialty player is called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.collegebaseballhall.org/john_olerud.jsp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John Olerud Award&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In most sports, the lower (or younger) levels are dominated on mostly by talent.  Once the highest levels are reached, most players are very talented and the players that work the hardest and train the hardest will be the most successful.  If is hard to out work and out train two different groups of players at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One last comment, position players will come in to pitch in blow out games some times.  This is usually just to save the innings and pitch count number for the relief pitchers in the bullpen over the course of the season.  These guys are not seen as two way players, even if they pitched in college or high school.  They are simply position players pitching in blow outs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/news/2000/08/22/braves_rockies_ap/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A position player getting the win in extra innings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="2157" LastActivityDate="2014-06-09T15:51:48.753" CommentCount="6"/>

Some would doubt the inclusion of Babe Ruth to the list because most of his incredible pitching statistics were done when he was principally a pitcher for the Red Sox.  Many of the other &quot;non-pitchers&quot; with substantial stats as pitchers played 100 years ago.  But of those from the &quot;modern&quot; era of baseball, one name stands out -- Jimmy Foxx.  The Hall of Fame 3B and Catcher offered to pitch when needed for the Phillies in his last season, 1945, when his hitting had gone sour because of declining eye sight.  Still, the war was still going on, and the player pool was thin.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One biographer captured that year:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;Foxx hit the last seven home runs of his career for the Phillies, but what made his final season unique was his turn on the pitching mound. Volunteering to help the team out in any way he could, Foxx pitched 23 innings, with a 1-0 record and 1.59 ERA. His high point on the mound came in the second game of a doubleheader on August 19, when Foxx pitched five no-hit innings in an emergency start. (He had pitched once very briefly while with the 1939 Red Sox.) His last major-league at-bat came against the Dodgers on September 23. At the close of the season Foxx retired for good, with a .325 lifetime batting average, 2,646 hits, and 534 home runs&#x2014;a total that was second only to Ruth until 1966.  His total of 1,922 runs batted in still ranked as 8th all time in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/e34a045d&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/e34a045d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="4865" LastActivityDate="2014-06-24T20:44:03.840" CommentCount="0"/>

Provided its a tie game or you are down by one.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The riskiest is the suicide squeeze. This is a decent percentage play, but comes with a good amount of risk. The batter bunts the ball and as the ball is pitched the runner on third breaks for the plate. The batter &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; get the bat on the ball or the play becomes a straight steal of home which requires a good bit of luck (or panache on the part of the runner) to pull off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to the first, the safety squeeze is another option. This play is very similar to the squeeze bunt, but the runner waits until the batter has the bunt down to commit to going home. If the opposing team elects to go to first with the ball, the runner is usually safe, but if the fielder goes home, it's a much lower percentage play than a squeeze with a successful bunt. In general squeeze plays are desperate attempts when there is no other hope (generally a terrible batter is up). Article &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lookoutlanding.com/2013/8/19/4634526/the-squeeze-play-how-to-feel-about-it-spoiler-alert-not-good&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; goes more in depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most conventional option here is the sacrifice fly. In this play the batter attempts to hit a fly ball deep enough to score the runner from third (the runner is allowed to tag the base and advance if the ball is caught and there aren't 3 outs). The problem here is that &lt;em&gt;trying to hit a sac fly&lt;/em&gt; isn't actually something hitters have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hardballtimes.com/do-batters-try-to-hit-sacrifice-flies/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;much control over&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a lot of hitters, hitting a deep fly ball isn't a great option (they just don't have the power or that's simply not their game). In this case, a sharp grounder to the right side of the infield may lead to the run that they need. Usually when there is a runner on third and the game is very close, the infield will play in on the grass, this provides them with ample opportunity to throw the ball home, but leaves them susceptible to well hit grounders getting through to the outfield scoring hte runner. Again, this isn't necessarily something hitters have a huge amount of control over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last option is actually the best in a late and close situation if you are down a run. That is simply to &lt;em&gt;change nothing about your approach&lt;/em&gt;. Here's the thing, if there are fewer than 2 outs, there is a runner on third, just simply taking a &lt;em&gt;normal approach&lt;/em&gt; leaves you with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tangotiger.net/re24.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;run expectancy&lt;/a&gt; of between 1.43 (0 out), and .989 (1 out). The odds of scoring a single run are between 85% (1 out) and 67%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So from the fact that squeezes are high risk, relatively low reward (back yourself out of a potential big inning or worse any run scoring situation at all) and the fact that how you hit the ball is something of a crapshoot, the absolute best thing you can do is...rely on your hitters to do their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The truth is, with an &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; ML hitter at bat (or even any hitter above replacement level one to be honest), your best bet is actually to just let them bat. You'll score about 1 run per inning in a situation with a runner on third and 1 out.

So if the player was placed on the DL 10 days after he had last played (the limit for retroactive DL placement), he might be eligible to come off in just 5 days. Generally this is suboptimal, but teams will often let a player sit a few days to see if he can still play before placing him on the DL.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That said, the number of days is counted from the last date that the player played.

Although slices have similar effects to knuckleballs after they bounce, the player receiving the ball can see clearly when and how his opponent slices the ball, so there is almost never a surprise in the direction of the ball after it bounces.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The closest thing to a knuckleball in terms of having know spin would be a completely flat groundstroke. By swinging straight through the ball, you can create minimal spin. This is very uncommon because it is difficult to produce a ball with no spin at all, but, more practically, flat groundstrokes are very uncommon because flatter balls are easy for the opponent to hit. A shot with backspin will force the opponent to adjust to the strange bounce, and the ball will slow down after bouncing, forcing the opponent to create more power rather than redirecting the ball's pace back across the court. A topspin shot, on the other hand, will fall more quickly, allowing the player to hit the ball harder without fear that it will go long. When the ball bounces, it jumps up and back towards the baseline, leading to a difficult ball for the opponent.

Most of the time this is the first three years of a player's service time, but it can continue longer. The rules are that any player who is sent down and spends 20 or more days in the minor leagues burns up an option year. It does not matter whether a player is ever on the 25 man roster, if he's on the 40 man, and playing in the minors, he's probably burning an option year.  (Players are often placed on the 40 man roster prior to their callup in order to protect them from the rule 5 draft.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A player who is currently in an option year can be called up and sent down freely. A player who does not have any options remaining must pass through the waiver wire before he can be sent to the minor leagues (this process removes him from the 40 man roster as well). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A fourth option year can be had if a player does not accrue 90 days of service time with an active professional club during his first year as a professional (so someone who only played rookie ball during his first professional year)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A player with 5 years of ML service time cannot be sent down to the minors without his consent regardless of whether or not he has cleared waivers or has options.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_transactions&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6" LastEditorUserId="6" LastEditDate="2014-07-16T17:16:27.953" LastActivityDate="2014-07-16T17:16:27.953" CommentCount="0"/>

They lift more weights, maintain better nutrition, and have access to technology and knowledge that has never existed before.  Increased strength and size allow pitchers to put more stress on their muscles and bones than ever.  Throwing a baseball is an extremely unnatural motion, and this is even more the case with today's stronger athletes.  Some people say that pitchers are so strong today that they're damaging their own bodies with the force their muscles can create (and the repetitive training they endure as they strive to apply such forces).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kids today spend far more time pitching and training at a young age than ever before.  As the sports industry grows (along with the money it offers) the incentive to succeed grows with it.  Youth sports today is more specialized than ever, with coaches expecting their athletes to focus on a single sport.  Today's young pitchers throw hundreds of pitches per week starting at a young age and continue through adulthood.  One of the leading theories about the cause of today's pitching injuries is that kids are throwing their arms out at a young age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctor's are better at detecting injuries today.  My guess is Nolan Ryan pitched through dozens of injuries during his career that would sideline pitchers today.  Professional pitchers have also become hundred-million dollar assets in today's sports, so doctors have more incentive than ever to protect them.  However, some people would argue that this protective approach could &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; be one of the causes of today's injury epidemic...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After writing #3, I did a quick google about Nolan Ryan (hoping for a good quote from the legend) and found another theory: that pitchers today are over-protected and get &quot;&lt;em&gt;babied&lt;/em&gt;&quot; too much by their managers.

But don't have the right players to pull off the trade directly with team B, but has players who are desirable to team C. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team B is out of contention, has a closer on an expiring contract, they don't want anyone in team A's system enough to trade their closer, but have had their eye on a couple of guys in Team C's system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team C is usually out of contention as well, but can sometimes be in contention (it doesn't usually benefit a contending team to do this, but an out of contention team can do well in a trade like this). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So team A will send their players who weren't the right mix for team B to team C, and team C will send their players to team B, who will send the closer to team A. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bleachernation.com/2014/07/18/friday-afternoon-fun-cubs-mariners-rays-in-a-david-price-three-team-deal/&quot;&gt;revealed &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; scenario&lt;/a&gt; actually has some interesting details and insights into this.

However, it requires that all sides, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; the intermediary thinking they are getting a good deal. This is largely why these deals don't happen. If a team doesn't have the players to get a deal done directly, it's very difficult to convince a third party that to give up their prospects (or ML talent in some cases) for players who weren't good enough for the 2 parties to swap directly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6" LastActivityDate="2014-07-21T14:43:56.950" CommentCount="2"/>

The first is Dan Uggla who you mention in the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Uggla was cut recently by the Braves, and went unclaimed on waivers, that made him a free agent. Since he is already getting paid for the rest of this season by the Braves, any team that wanted to sign him only has to pay him the major league minimum salary (regardless of whether they sign him to a major or minor league deal).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Giants, who need a second baseman, signed Uggla to a minor league deal (so they don't have to put him on their 40 man roster), with an opt out that he can take on August 1st if he feels like he will not make the big league club. Uggla can now go play for the Giants' AAA afiliate for a week or two and try to find his swing again. If the Giants want to keep him, they can bring him up before 8/1 and his opt out will be voided, they have a cheap 2B option who is better than the ones on their current roster. If they don't want to call him up, he can maybe do the same thing somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is something of a win-win for both parties, since Uggla is already getting paid this year by the Braves, he only has to worry about finding a team to play with (and possibly salvage some value to resign elsewhere next year), and since the Braves are paying the bills, this is a very low monetary risk for the Giants.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The other contract I want to look at is that of Tsuyoshi Wada. Wada was signed from Japan by the Orioles, but never played for them, he had Tommy John surgery. This past off season he was signed to a minor league deal with the Cubs, who released him and resigned him again (in what is believed to be a contract restructuring deal, I don't think all the details were made public). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rather than his contract being covered by another team, the Cubs are paying his full minor and then major league salary. He was signed because he was a guy who could rehab and possibly be something special and at the very best be a tradeworthy asset come July or a potential full time rotation candidate next year. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Consistent with that approach, he was called up this week to make his second big league start (it wasn't anything special). However, it's believe that the Cubs will trade him if they get an offer or try to keep him for next year. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This kind of rehab deal appeals to teams like the Cubs who are not likely to contend for the year and need assets that can fill roster spots or bring back even marginal prospects in trade, and it appeals to players because it can keep them in US professional baseball rather than them having to go somewhere else to finish their rehab and get back onto the diamond (Wada likely would have had to return to Japan if he had not been signed).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Uggla strategy is alright for a team that sees itself in contention and has a hole to fill as long as they can find out if their hole is filled prior to the trade deadline. The Wada strategy is that of rebuilding clubs. This isn't a way to restock your farm system as the kinds of players who sign minor league deals are not usually the kinds of prospects you reload with (though they can occasionally break out and be included in trades for them.

Then as the game became more popular and professional leagues formed, team owners realized that having a fence to contain the crowd would be better for business.  As more ballparks were built, their dimensions were sometimes limited by the surrounding streets.  For example, the close proximity of Lansdowne Street to the left field area of Fenway Park in Boston is why Fenway has such a short left field.  Physical limitations such as this prevented the ballparks from being able to exactly match the dimensions and shapes of other ballparks.  MLB realized they wouldn't be able to standardize on any one set of dimensions, so they allowed the differences in the ballparks to remain.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="3763" LastActivityDate="2014-07-27T08:19:32.710" CommentCount="1"/>

If it is a violation of doctoring the ball, Wax Eagle is correct.  Most of the time (not always) a balk has to do with the pitcher having trouble with the &quot;set position&quot; (ie not coming all the way set, coming set in an illegal way, etc.).  All runners advance one base.  There are a few things about a balk depending on the situation:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If a pitcher balks and throws a pitch, the batter may swing and the play will be live.  The runners may advance without penalty one base forward.  However if the runner is tagged out after advancing safely one base, the balk is discarded and the live play is counted.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If the runners advance safely throughout the completion of the play, or they are tagged out or forced out before they reach the next base, the offense may select the result of the play or the balk.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The criteria for a balk with runners on and the bases empty are very different.  If you want more of an explanation on this let me know.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If there are no runners on, a balk will be counted as a ball to the batter.  Balks without runners on are very rare.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the situation you describe, the batter would not walk if there is a balk unless he doctored the baseball, but both runners advance and the run scores.  On a walk, the man on first moves to second and the man on third may advance home at his own risk (may be tagged out by the defense for an out).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/pitcher_8.jsp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mlb Rule 8, Pitching&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="2157" LastEditorUserId="2157" LastEditDate="2014-08-14T21:10:05.657" LastActivityDate="2014-08-14T21:10:05.657" CommentCount="0"/>

If we assume it's late game, the score is tied, and the pitcher is &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; going to pitch one more inning (with a slightly better than average bullpen), then we can go from there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, with the pitcher up 3rd in the order, there are three possibile situations:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;None on, 2 out&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One on 1 out (runner on 1/2/3)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Two on, 2 out.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to assume three things:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The pinch hitter has about a 50% chance of improving the run frequency of the inning (walk, hit, sac fly)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The pitcher will succeed on a sac bunt 90% of the time (it's not this high)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The pitcher swinging away will advance the run frequency of the inning about 20% of the time.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's examine the possible &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tangotiger.net/RE9902score.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;run frequencies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tangotiger.net/RE9902.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;run expectancies&lt;/a&gt; of our starting state:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;none on 2 out: 0.117 (number of runs you're likely to score)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In this case it doesn't matter who hits. The pitcher should probably do so if he will be better than a reliever. The run expectancy is already so low, that the unlikely case of a homerun from either party is the only thing that will truly improve it (obviously that's an automatic run). The most likely outcome from a pinch hitter, a single or a walk, only really raises the run expectancy to .251 runs. Still quite unlikely&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 on, 1 out: .573/.725/.983 (runs you're expected to score). Let's look at our three scenarios here.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let the pitcher hit: pitchers generally get on base at less than .200, and their most likely result is a K, so let's look at where that leaves our run expectancies: .251/.344/.387. If the pitcher manages to advance the runner we have .344/.378/1.117(since a run scores). It the pitcher manages to get a single, that will provides us a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more possibilities, more than I can list here (view the matrix to see for your self). However, for the sake of argument, let's assume that a pitcher getting a hit always leads to exactly 1 run. So let's see on average, the pitcher striking (or otherwise failing to advance the runner) out drops .4, advancing the runners drops .1 and getting a hit raises it by .3. If we assume that the pitcher has a 50% chance of not advancing the runner, a 20% chance of a hit, and a 30% chance of advancing the runner. Than the average change is .2 * .3 - .5 * .4 - .3 * .1 = -.17&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sac bunt is a bit easier to figure. Going from 1 out to 2 is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; bad for run expectancy and should be avoided. Sac bunting is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the pinch hitter, we can use the same formula we used for the pitcher, and tweak the odds. He is much more likely to get a hit or draw a walk, being that he's a bench player, we'll call it .35. Add in another 30% chance to advance the runner   .35 * .3 - .3 * .4 - .35 * .1 = -.05. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;two on, no out: 1.904/2.052/2.417. This is a huge situation, and an automatic out does not automatically kill your rally here. However, it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; lessen the chance of scoring multiple runs pretty significantly. A sac bunt is still a terrible play (the only time it's even close to even is, with 0 outs, getting a runner from second to third). This is a definite spot for a pinch hitter, as the higher contact rate and much higher OBP will lead to better results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So suffice to say, if there is a runner on, it's almost always better to pinch hit in this circumstance. No matter who pitches the 7/8/9 the odds are good you are going to need another run to keep pace and two to win. So it's a good idea to pinch hit for your pitcher if you even have a chance to score. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6" LastActivityDate="2014-08-14T20:33:36.547" CommentCount="1"/>

There are &lt;em&gt;really great&lt;/em&gt; reasons to pick under slot players early in the draft. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, a bit on how the draft slotting system works. Each draft position in the first ten rounds has a dollar value assigned. The first pick in the draft is worth a certain dollar amount, the last pick in the tenth round is worth significantly less money.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The dollar values for the picks a team controls are summed together to form a teams &quot;bonus pool&quot;. They can use this money to sign all of the players they draft. If you exceed this pool you must pay penalties. The first 10% is just monetary penalties, if you spend more than 10% you start forfeiting future draft picks (which also means less bonus pool money in the following years). There is a great primer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bleachernation.com/2014/06/04/2014-mlb-draft-primer-bonus-pool-slot-values-penalties-etc/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on draft slots and the penalties.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Any player a team drafts &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the tenth round may be signed for up to $100k without counting against their bonus pool. However, any amount they spend over 100k does count against their pool from the first 10 rounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing. The first four or so draft slots are huge, significantly larger than the other draft slots. So if a team drafts a player in one of those slots who they know will sign for less money, they get to save a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of money to be able to draft high risk players in the later rounds and offer them larger bonuses than other teams would be able to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is important for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First, if a player is a highschool graduate, a large bonus may lure them away from their college commitment (or if they are a junior, it may entice them to leave school early).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It allows you to draft hard to sign players in the first ten rounds, earlier than other teams. There is an emerging strategy to draft hard to sign players &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the start of the 10th round, so that you get the free 100k, and so that if you fail to sign the player, the money for the slot is not lost (As it would be if you drafted them in rounds 1-9). &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basically, if you draft under slot early, it allows you to get &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; better talent by drafting guys over slot late. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Brett Taylor, who covers the Cubs on his blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bleachernation.com/2014/06/17/checking-in-on-the-chicago-cubs-draft-signings-and-bonus-pool/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bleacher Nation&lt;/a&gt;, has written several articles on the Cubs' use of this draft strategy. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bleachernation.com/2014/06/11/more-on-first-round-pick-kyle-schwarber-signing-position-progression-and-horses/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here's&lt;/a&gt; his article about the Cubs' top pick in 2014, a significantly underslot signing that allowed the Cubs to have one of the years best drafts.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To address the specific case you mention. It's probably two things. First the talent falls of pretty hard after about the first ten picks every year. So most likely they had a few guys at that level who they liked, and everything else being equal, you take the guy you can sign for less money (so you can sign another good player later). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The other factor is that the draft can be a real crapshoot. Sure you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to get the sure thing superstars, but there might only be 5 of those in a given draft. So you stock up on highish level guys. There might not be a lot of seperation between three or four guys one of whom might sign below slot.

As such, when a balk is called, the game situation is treated as if the runners had been stealing a base, and they are awarded one base.  This goes a bit beyond a 'return to equity' of course, as often no runners are going when a balk is called, but that is the general reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;From the comment on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/pitcher_8.jsp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the specific rule&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;Comment: Umpires should bear in mind that the purpose of the balk rule is to prevent the pitcher from deliberately deceiving the base runner.&lt;br&gt;&#10;  If there is doubt in the umpires mind, the intent of the pitcher should govern. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a balk &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; results in a ball to the batter.  Instead, there are a few possible situations where a ball to the batter might be given &lt;em&gt;instead&lt;/em&gt; of a balk, or &lt;em&gt;in addition to&lt;/em&gt; a balk; but the term &lt;code&gt;balk&lt;/code&gt; specifically applies only to the advancement of the runners.  Note the comment to 8.05e (the Quick Pitch rule):&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;With runners on base the penalty is a balk; with no runners on base, it is a ball.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And 8.02a (the Doctored Ball rule referred to by diggers), when a play occurs and the manager does not elect to accept the play's results:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;(d) If the manager of the team at bat does not elect to accept the play, the umpire-inchief shall call an automatic ball and, if there are any runners on base, a balk.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the balk and the ball are clearly separate items.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also note that if a balk and a walk occur simultaneously - as could occur in either of the two above situations - any runners who would be 'forced' by the walk do not gain an additional base.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6232" LastActivityDate="2014-08-15T22:13:40.630" CommentCount="0"/>
  
<row Id="5543" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="5464" CreationDate="2014-08-15T22:46:24.713" Score="3" Body="&lt;p&gt;On your first point: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fangraphs.com/library/business/mlb-salary-arbitration-rules/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Fangraphs&lt;/a&gt; certainly agrees with you that old metrics seem to dominate.  There are no hard and fast rules about which stats are presentable, though; it's solely due to who is hearing the case - and there is no doubt that stats (both old and new) have made a huge difference (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=15864&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Baseball Prospectus'&lt;/a&gt;** article on Arbitration, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A list of what evidence you may present:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;The following evidence is admissable:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;ul&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;The quality of the player's contribution to his club during the past season (including but not limited to his overall performance, special qualities of leadership and public appeal).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;The length and consistency of his career contribution.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;The record of the player's past compensation.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;Comparative baseball salaries (the arbitration panel is provided with a table of confidential baseball salaries for all players broken down by years of service).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;The existence of any physical or mental defects on the part of the player.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;The recent performance of the club, including but not limited to his league standing and attendance.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;hr&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Second, as to why 'younger' players get less: Players and their agents are only allowed to compare themselves to other players in their service year or players with one year more service time.  As much of the success of the arbitration is due to finding other players with the same stats, this significantly limits the argument that players may have compared to the market-inflated salaries.  The arbitrator basically can only compare the player to other players in arbitration, until they are in their last year of arbitration; so Mike Trout cannot be compared to Albert Pujols, for example, despite the fact that any idiot would sign Trout for more than Pujols at this point.  This can be argued to be waived in the case of 'special' players (see: Trout), but typically it does not yield nearly the 'market' salary nonetheless.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;From BP:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;In other words, Super Twos can be compared to Super Twos and three-year players, but not four-year players. Threes can be compared to other threes and fours, but not fives. The exception is that fives can compare themselves to anyone, just like free agents. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Further, this likely leads to aggressive signing of young superstar players to pre-arb contracts, like Mike Trout ($24M/year for 6 years); this is because owners want to avoid setting overly large arbitration precedents and schedule when money will be delivered such that it doesn't inflate other salaries.  Trout will earn $24MM a year, but it is back loaded: 5MM in (service) year 3, 15MM in year 4, 19MM in year 5, then 33MM in the last 3 years (service years 6,7,8).  This helps avoid large arbitration comps for other players somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They certainly do not reflect market salaries would be, even in the final year of arbitration (though they do get closer).  The market salary is effectively the highest amount any one GM thinks a player is worth, and bakes into it not only the past performance of the player, but the likely future performance as well - some years of control over the player, expected growth, and such.  Arbitration salaries do not consider this 'future performance', except as it may be realized in other players' comparative salaries - which, remember, are also arbitration derived until the final year.  In addition, the fact that no teams are bidding 'against' the team and player means that the arbitrators' decision does not include the additional money a player likely would receive from other owners bidding on his talents.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;hr&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally, your third point is correct: the arbitrator must choose one of the two options.  In theory, the arbitrator would compare the midpoint of the two proposed salaries to the determined 'correct' salary and choose the one closest, but as BP notes in the earlier-linked article, that is not set in stone, and they may make their decision based on whatever they choose - which probably depresses extreme salaries some.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;hr&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As far as your questions at the end: the system works largely because it's a compromise between the players (who would like earlier free agency) and the owners (who would prefer six years of complete control).  It probably benefits the clubs slightly, particularly as it's easy to identify certain players who are likely to receive 'bad' awards (closers in particular seem to get overly high awards - hence trades like the Addison Reed trade in the 2013/14 offseason) and cut them without cost; but it certainly is helpful to players as well compared to what it would be otherwise, and the owners are unlikely to agree to completely open free agency after 3 or 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why did it exist? Read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hardballtimes.com/all-about-arbitration/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hardball Times&lt;/a&gt; article linked in the other answer; it explains how it came to pass in the 1970s.  Basically, arbitration existed before free agency, after the 1974 strike/lockout; it was the compromise that allowed salaries to have at least some tie to performance (before that, owners set the salary for a player, and a player could play for that salary or not play baseball at all due to the reserve clause).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reason it is Final Offer Arbitration is because that is common in labor negotiations.  See the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration_in_the_United_States#Arbitrators&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wiki on Arbitration&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;It is designed to encourage the parties to moderate their initial positions so as to make it more likely they receive a favourable decision.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Without it, both sides likely would make outraegous offers.  Still happens sometimes (see: Eric Gagne) but in general clubs and players are within a million or so in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;hr&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;** The BP article I linked is from 2012.  In 2013, a major change was made that removed the 'free agent' arbitration option, so that no longer applies.  Clubs now may tender a qualifying contract to FAs (a bit north of $14MM in 2014), which retains their rights to draft pick compensation, but there is no risk of an arbitrator awarding the player more.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6232" LastEditorUserId="6232" LastEditDate="2014-08-15T23:01:05.177" LastActivityDate="2014-08-15T23:01:05.177" CommentCount="0"/>

Each sport additionally has its own variables; Baseball has fully guaranteed and very large contracts, and a large prospect body (the minors).  Football has non-guaranteed contracts with large signing bonuses (that don't follow the player, even in the salary cap hit) and no minor league, but players at some positions take years to develop while at other positions only have a few highly productive years.  Basketball has a very small minor league, players who have instant impacts at relatively near their full potential, and guaranteed contracts with a salary cap.  These aspects have a major impact on how trades work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For baseball, some trades are basically dumps (minimal prospects or just 'cash', in exchange for salary relief - Adam Dunn for example), and some trades are for the prospects primarily (David Price, for example).  Some trades are for a mixture of both, as the sending team agrees to pay some salary in exchange for a better prospect.  The needs of the two teams and the prospects available drive that, plus the quality of the player traded.  More value as a player means either more salary relief, or better or more prospect(s).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The long answer:&lt;br&gt;&#10;For baseball, you can generally think of a player as having two valuations: the cost of the player, and the actual production of the player valued in how much it would cost to replace that production on  the free agent market.  This, obviously, isn't an exact science, and each team likely has its own calculations on value.  Additionally, you consider the productivity of the player he would replace in the lineup (when evaluating a player who will start or play for a winning team); filling a hole that has a negative-value player is obviously more interesting than one where a star already resides.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Teams making trades generally are considering both values together.  A player who costs $10 million and produces at $15 million has $5 million in excess value; a player who costs $10 million and produces at $5 million has negative 5 million dollars in excess value. The former player would likely cost a significant prospect to acquire; the latter player might be traded for very little value (perhaps a minor prospect or two providing organizational depth, or simply for the salary dump).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In fact, you often see combinations: a team will trade a player and pay some of his salary, in exchange for a better prospect (or more prospects).  Small market teams are less likely to be interested in this sort of trade (as the money has significant value); the Rays for example would prefer to trade more salary away, unless they like specific prospects a lot.  The White Sox on the other hand have a relatively weak depth of minor league talent, and while not a top-tier team in terms of income can generally afford higher salaries, and thus are more interested in acquiring talent than solely dumping salary.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can look at Fangraphs' Value section to get an idea of how much a player is valued.  Typically, a WAR (win above replacement) is currently valued at around $5 million dollars (although this number varies by year, and generally increases over time).  Let's take Adam Dunn as an example.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=319&amp;amp;position=1B/OF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=319&amp;amp;position=1B/OF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This year, he has been rated at 0.4 WAR, which equates to a value of around $2 million.  He might earn another 0.1 the rest of the year, so say 0.5 million dollars from the date of the trade until the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Oakland had a significant need at DH for a left handed bat (and for some power), and thus probably valued Dunn at higher than 0.1 WAR for the month; he is replacing essentially a below-replacement bat since Jaso was injured.  They might value him at, say, 0.5 wins for the month, or even 1 win.  Thus, they're willing to pay between 2.5M and 5M for him, in total value.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He had a total salary of about 2.3 million remaining for the month (of his $15 million), of which the White Sox paid $1.3 million and the Athletics paid $1 million.  Thus, the Athletics are acquiring a bit of a bargain if they are indeed replacing negative WAR with his slightly positive WAR.  The White Sox are losing very little value (they're out of the race, and didn't really need his bat anyway, as they have too many 1B bats already), so it didn't take much to convince them to give up Dunn: a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fangraphs.com/fantasy/the-athletic-adam-dunn/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;former prospect turned reliever with shoulder issues&lt;/a&gt;, as Fangraphs describes it.  Of course, the White Sox have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=320421112&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=1841&amp;amp;position=P&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/loaizes01.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;success&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/contrjo01.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;rehabilitating&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3886&amp;amp;position=P&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;prospects&lt;/a&gt; like this thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/69599862/chicago-white-sox-pitching-coach-don-cooper-is-one-of-the-best-in-the-business#!bPPYvt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Don Cooper&lt;/a&gt; plus some luck, so this may also have been a plus from their side.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Either way, you can see that in this particular trade, you have one side trading away a relatively small trading chip for a relatively small gain- and the other side taking a small chip and some salary relief.  This is pretty common in these sorts of trades.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trades of players with high salaries AND high values, such as Cole Hamels, are harder to accomplish, because the Phillies would expect a good value prospect in return, but aren't really trading a lot of excess value: he is paid $20 million a year, and is worth about $20 million (around 4 WAR).  You have to have a team who's in a very strong 'win now' mode, and has an extra prospect or two to cash in.  This is more likely to happen with a team like the Cubs, for example, who might think they're basically there but have an extra top prospect without a need (they have 3 SS prospects, plus Starlin Castro, so they are worth more as trade chips than they are to the Cubs presently) and a desperate need for good starting pitching; someone like the Tigers or the Yankees probably don't have the depth to make a good trade, and have high salaries already.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Prospects have significant value in large part from their cost control due to the CBA.  Players for their first 5 (usually) years are very underpaid (see the previous arbitration question for more details); the first two years they're typically paid under a million dollars each year, and even a top player will likely earn a total of $25 million for the 5 year span.  That top player might earn 15 WAR over that span (or more!), thus producing a value of around $70 million for a cost of $25 million.  Obviously, all but the top prospects are risky bets - even a graduated college senior like Carlos Rodon isn't a guaranteed sure thing; as such, that $55 million surplus is valued at something of a discount; but you might see something like $25 million in value from a top prospect, and even a near-replacement level player is worth at least $3-5 million in excess value - just 2 WAR over a six year span would be worth $10 million.  This is how teams like Tampa Bay and Oakland manage to compete without high salaries; they have many 0.5-1 WAR players earning a million or less each, thus producing 10-15 WAR for the team as a whole without significant cost.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6232" LastEditorUserId="6232" LastEditDate="2014-09-09T14:12:49.000" LastActivityDate="2014-09-09T14:12:49.000" CommentCount="4"/>

It indicates the proportion of times a batter reaches base safely not due to an error when a baserunner occupies second or third base (or both) when he is at bat.  That tends to mean that batter has been responsible for batting in a lot of runs (as a proportion of opportunities).  Personally, I would group it in with Runs Scored, Pitcher Wins, RBIs, and other statistics that are very helpful for indicating how well a player &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;, but not necessarily indication of likely future performance (except insomuch as they may be proxies for what kind of team he's on).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is it meaningful &lt;em&gt;for projecting future performance&lt;/em&gt;?  I doubt it; according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2013/6/13/4423944/2013-cardinals-estimating-clutch-skill&quot;&gt;Beyond the Box Score&lt;/a&gt;, there is a .21 correlation year-over-year in team BARISP.  They misuse the word 'significant' there, but it's forgivable as it's probably not meant as a statistics term.  It is, certainly, a weak correlation; but it's not a zero one, so perhaps it has some small predictive value.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thinking about it from a 'how' sense, you could attribute it to 'playing better under pressure', which is mostly nonsense but not entirely.  You could attribute it to a particular batting style that favors contact and line drives over fly balls - I doubt Adam Dunn's BARISP is particularly good, for example (it's 20 points lower for his career than his batting average, in fact), but Tony Gwynn does have a higher BARISP than his career batting average, by 14 points.  Maybe some players change their swing in ways that happen to yield a better average - with a guy on second you swing for a single, but with the bases empty you just go for the home run (again, see Dunn, Adam for a  great example).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thus, it seems to me that it's not a 100% pure junk statistic; but with a low correlation coefficient, it mostly is, and particularly as it's used for a &quot;clutch&quot; indicator (which most statisticians laugh at).  More likely it explains for certain players intentional changes in their game geared towards scoring runs, and for most players just signifies the noise that is random number generators, aka baseball at-bats.  (My next pseudo-random number generator will be based on an initial seed, and the outcome of each at-bat in a major league season.  Why not?)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I'd warn of the risk of circular reasoning.  We often see 'good' batters singled out for having a good BARISP, and it being used as evidence for why they're good.  Well, sure, a player who was luckier than most of his teammates in that when he happened to get his 130 hits for the season, 80 of those times a guy was on second and/or third, will be a 'good' player versus a player who only had a guy in scoring position 30 times.  Thus, taking as evidence that BARISP is a good statistic the fact that 'good' players have a good BARISP is circular.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is further discussed all over the internet; see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseballmusings.com/archives/009154.php&quot;&gt;this article by David Pinto&lt;/a&gt;, for another good take on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6232" LastActivityDate="2014-09-07T03:11:45.097" CommentCount="1"/>

And there are a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of factors that come into play, but I'm going to keep it simple here.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, almost &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; pitcher is more effective if he pitches fewer innings in an outing, if he pitches fewer days of the week, and if he throws fewer pitches when he does pitch. It's important to also note that this is the rule and that many many exceptions exist.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to know that there are only so many guys in the league who can go through the same batting order 3 times and not give up a ton of hard hit balls the third time through the order. That means that for many starting pitchers their maximum efficacy is 6 innings. There is even a stat for this, it's called the Quality Start, that's when you go at least 6 and give up fewer than 4 earned runs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So that's why we have starters and relievers. Now, why do relievers have specific jobs in the bullpen?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mostly because most pitchers are really effective at one thing. Left handed relievers are super useful because a lot of the best power hitters are left handed and it's hard for lefties to hit off of left handed pitchers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Closers are usually your best reliever, would he be a good starter? Maybe? But a lot of the best closers are guys who started for a while and got hurt and needed to pitch shorter duration outings (see John Smoltz), or really young guys who can't yet handle the innings load of a starter's schedule (see Aroldis Chapman, though he's stuck at closer for a while now).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of your relievers are guys who were drafted as starters and washed out in the minors from starting roles because they couldn't cut it. Heck a lot of guys who pitch in relief even started in the majors for a while before being replaced by someone who is better at it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The fact is that there are only so many guys who can handle pitching even multiple innings at the major league level. Look at the rotation of your favorite team. How much better than the second or third best reliever is the 4th starter? It's pretty stark, if you asked that reliever to stretch out and start, he'd fare much worse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So why not change it up and let one guy pitch the last three innings of a start? This is actually something you see in the minors, and is also something you'll sometimes see in the majors in September when rosters expand and teams are trying to get their young guys extra innings to see what they have before they have to make roster decisions in the off season.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, the problem is, with a normal roster, if you let a guy pitch 3 innings in a night, he's not going to be available for another several days after that. You play baseball &lt;em&gt;every, single day&lt;/em&gt; almost. So you've only got 12 or 13 pitchers, and you're using up two every 5th day, you've only got two or three guys who can come in if either of your starters gets hurt or gets in trouble in a game. That's not a good position to be in.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Other than the trouble or injury factor, you also have a talent issue. Major league hitters are &lt;em&gt;really good&lt;/em&gt; and if you put pitchers out there who are over extended for their talent levels, they &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be eaten alive. Most ML pitchers can handle and inning, maybe 2, but often by the third inning, a player is seeing them for a second time in that outing, and then it's curtains. It's a rare talent to be able to go through the batting order a second time, more so a third and even rarer a fourth time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, a reliever is such because he has a limited pitch selection (one of the greatest relievers of all time, Mariano Rivera basically got buy on 1 pitch). A starter has 3 or 4 and can mix things up to get through the order a few times with minimal damage. A reliever is usually good for an inning or a batter and that's the limit to his efficacy. If there were enough starters to go around, you might not see specialization like this, but there are a limited number of guys who can pitch even 6 big league innings, so we have relievers.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not sure where to stick this so it gets put in a post script. &lt;a href=&quot;http://bigbadbaseball.blogspot.com/2013/08/earned-run-average-era-inning-by-inning.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a really cool chart and it illustrates what I'm talking about using ERA. If you look, especially at the last line, the MLB numbers. You can see that the first inning is universally pretty rough, but after that a starter settles in it is pretty good, until about the 5th or 6th inning, and their ERA starts to creep up again.

However, flamethrowing relievers typically lose 2-3 MPH from their fastballs when converted to starters; look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fangraphs.com/pitchfx.aspx?playerid=10603&amp;amp;position=P&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Chris Sale&lt;/a&gt; for example. He was primarily a reliever his first two years (2010-2011) and then became a starter after that.  He averaged 95 MPH as a reliever, and 93 MPH as a starter on his fastball - and had much, much higher maximums; as a reliever he threw 100 MPH his first year in the majors, and hasn't hit much over 98 since he became a starter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is why certain pitchers typically are designated as relievers in the current day, even if they're quite talented; look at Aroldis Chapman, for example.  He's one of the best pitchers of any sort in the majors, and he's a reliever despite attempting to make him a starter: that's because as a reliever he can simply throw the ball past his opponents (hitting 100MPH on over half of his pitches this season).  He'd likely lose a few MPH as a starter, and might be less effective.  (He might still be more valuable to the team, but that's a coach and general managers' decision to make.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Long relievers aren't used (most of the time) because they'd be getting the worst of both worlds.  They couldn't throw as hard, because they'd be needed for 60 ish pitches, but they'd only be throwing 1/3 of a game (versus a starter throwing upwards of 2/3).  They also wouldn't be able to pitch all that often (relievers who do pitch 3 innings due to a bad starter's performance usually get several days off afterwards).  Instead, you can have three guys each throw very hard, plus the flexibility as Wax Eagle notes to pitch to matchups and such, gaining overall more out of your bullpen than you would if you had fewer, longer relievers.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6232" LastActivityDate="2014-09-23T04:34:16.120" CommentCount="0"/>

If A wins, they are pitching their #2 starter vs C's #1.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Because home field advantage in baseball isn't a strong indicator of success Home teams only win about 54% of their games (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=18572&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;same in postseason and regular season&lt;/a&gt;) at home. However, usually teams match up their best starters against each other in a playoff series. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the first game favors team A by about 4%. Team C is going to have an advantage in the second game, even though they are the away team, because their #1 gets to go against the #2 of the team that won. Depending on the quality of team A's #2 starter, this may give team B enough of an edge to &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; turn the game into a coinflip affair.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, there is an additional consideration here. It's all about how much time passes between the tiebreaker game and the start of the first playoff series (or the wild card game). Team C might look at the matchup, and run out their #2 having confidence that he can beat the other team's #2 and save their rotation from getting out of whack in the first playoff series. This is a game theory decision and should be informed by way more math than I can pack into this little post (at least without running on for several pages and doing a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more research that's not directly relevant here). If this happens, and we assume that #2 starters are equivalent, we're back to that 54% edge for the home team.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So, depending on how much of an impact you believe starting pitchers have on the outcome of a game (I tend to think it's a fair amount), the tie breaker situation either favors team C, but not by very much, or team A, but again, not by very much.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reality is that playoff baseball is a crapshoot.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6" LastActivityDate="2014-09-26T14:01:28.830" CommentCount="0"/>

It usually helps with the pitchers rhythm.  They are able to use a high leg kick and deliver a pitch.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some relievers will pitch out of the stretch whether or not there is a runner on base.  This is because they often come in with runners on base and their rhythm is to pitch out of the stretch.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As for the stretch, it is used to deter the other teams runners from stealing a base.  If the pitcher was in the windup, as soon as he started his windup the runners can steal.  If the pitchers stops his windup that would be a balk with runners on base.  He can still pick from the windup by stepping off with his foot that is on the rubber. (RHP would step off with his right foot and vice versa for a LHP.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the stretch pitchers will slide step to deliver the ball quickly to home.  This is when they step to home without bringing their lead leg up very far from the ground.  Many pitchers can be around 1.2 seconds to home plate with the slide step, giving the catcher a good chance to throw a stealing runner out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basically the difference is in the time to the plate, which is why all pitchers pitch out of the stretch with runners on 1st and or 2nd.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One side note is that with a runner on third &lt;strong&gt;some&lt;/strong&gt; pitchers may choose to pitch out of the windup because in order to get the runner out stealing home, they simply have to get the ball to the catcher.

That is the only example in Baseball, though there really have only been two decades of history where it would be meaningful to say the two lowest seeds faced each other; prior to the wildcard, you only had one team from each division (so 4 total teams) in the playoffs, and with divisional play it's hard to say who would be seeded what in a larger playoff.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The NHL and NBA have longer histories of large seeded playoffs.  In the NHL, never have two 8 seeds faced each other, but in 2012 the Kings (8) beat the Devils (6) for the first 8 seed win in NHL history and the largest sum of seeds in the Finals history.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the NBA, 8 seeds nearly never beat 1 seeds; the 1998-1999 New York Knicks remain the only 8 seeds to reach the finals, losing to the Spurs (Duncan and Robinson's first championship).

This certainly isn't true, but it is hard to compare lower levels to the Major Leagues or Madison Bumgarner because they are the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are certainly pitchers in high school and college that are only capable of being a pitcher, and not playing another position, while there are also great athletes that pitch and play a position too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Usually those players that play a position and pitch aren't seen as P.O.'s (pitcher onlys), and they will receive treatment from others as a position player.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basically if you are a P.O. you are viewed as a lower athlete on the team, or you would be playing a position/hitting.  Mostly in fun players will joke with pitchers that they are worthless, poor athletes, etc.  Pitchers often accept this joking and will be able to laugh with position players after a great (athletic) play, or coming up in a big situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;College baseball is also a very &quot;earn your stripes&quot; culture.

(See &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.mlb.com/news/article/97802528/how-much-did-short-rest-affect-dodgers-ace-clayton-kershaw-in-game-4&quot;&gt;Clayton Kershaw&lt;/a&gt; in the 2014 playoffs as an example.)  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And nowadays if a pitcher somehow pitches well on 2 days rest, like Madison Bumgarner did in Game 7 of the 2014 World Series, it is &lt;a href=&quot;http://deadspin.com/you-will-never-see-a-pitching-performance-like-that-aga-1652642819&quot;&gt;hailed as a legendary, impossible, once-in-a-lifetime performance&lt;/a&gt;.

There are at least two other compelling reasons, however.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, we live in an era of specialization when it comes to baseball.  Relief pitchers capable of coming into a ballgame and throwing in the mid 90s is a common sight today, whereas it would have been a rarer thing several decades ago (with the big increase in usage of relievers occurring between the 60s and the 90s).  When even a setup man is capable of pitching like an ace for one inning, the incentive to build up your rotation to the point where your starting pitchers are capable of tossing more innings isn't as strong.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Second, teams are far more concerned about injuries today than they were fifty years ago, and pitcher injuries in particular receive far more scrutiny than they used to.  Many talented pitchers back then hurt their elbows or shoulders and ended up losing out on what would have otherwise been a potentially solid career.  This was, effectively, a screening process whereby the players less likely to get hurt stuck around and racked up high innings totals.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="7656" LastActivityDate="2014-11-30T21:39:36.067" CommentCount="1"/>
  
<row Id="7249" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="7221" CreationDate="2014-12-01T18:14:22.667" Score="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;The major reason players pitch on four days rest is that they are better pitchers when they do so.  They are able to throw harder, throw more pitches, and throw more difficult pitches (with more spin/etc.) than they would if they had less rest.  They are also less prone to injury.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some evidence exists that pitching on three days rest in the postseason (where it's somewhat common); for example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1812391-does-throwing-top-pitchers-on-short-rest-pay-off-in-the-postseason&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this article at BleacherReport&lt;/a&gt; finds pitchers pitching on three days rest (who are usually the ace or #2 pitcher of a team) have a 4.48 ERA and win less than 40% of the games they pitch.  Some of this may be pitchers being unused to pitching in those circumstances (and pitching against fairly good teams, it being the postseason); but it does seem logical that pitching on short rest is somewhat harder.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The other major factor is the fact that for &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; teams, the fifth starter isn't all that much worse than the fourth starter.  While a few teams might have four great starters and then a poor fifth starters (the 2014 Tigers post-Price trade for example), the large amount of starting talent plus the ability to use multiple relievers means you wouldn't lose much by starting that fifth starter, particularly if it allows you to have better performances on the other four days.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the question is what's the difference between then and now, you'll probably find that the major difference is in modern strength techniques allowing pitchers to throw that much harder; this both increases the number of pitchers who can competently pitch, and increases the benefit from rest - I'd rather have my starter hit 94 on most of his pitches every fifth day, rather than throw at 92 every fourth day.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;hr&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The other issue with this is the premise of the question - namely, that the four man rotation was very common 20-30 years ago.  This is simply untrue.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reading SABR's &lt;a href=&quot;http://sabr.org/research/origins-pitching-rotation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Origins of the Pitching Rotation&lt;/a&gt; by Frank Vaccaro, the 5 man rotation existed in the 1930s, and even in the 1930s was the most common kind of rotation.  See the chart (unfortunately very low DPI) in that article; by 1935 more teams pitched with a five man rotation than a four man rotation.  If I have some time (maybe on the train home) I'll download the retrosheet data he used and make a better chart.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, you typically had 20-30 pitchers who started at least 36 games (a true four man rotation would start 40).  Given &lt;em&gt;every pitcher on a team&lt;/em&gt; would start that many games in a true four man rotation, that means a whopping 8 to 10 teams may have had four man rotations; the rest likely had five man rotations.  If you up the number of games started to 40 (again, the true four man rotation), you are in the teens or less in the 1970s - so maybe a handful of teams had a true four man rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Many teams had modified 4 man - 4 day rest rotations during this period, where a team had four starters and used a fifth periodically when needed to keep them on four day rest.  This often led to #1 pitchers having 36-37 starts, so 3 or 4 more starts than the true 5 man rotation (33).  To some extent this fell out of style finally in the late 1980s and 1990s, where Bobby Cox and Joe Torre used true 5 man rotations with great success; while it seems like you might as well keep your aces on 5 days rest, it may be that an occasional sixth day is helpful for their rest, and/or keeping the 5th man on a regular rotation is better than having him only pitch every 10-20 days.  (It also may be largely irrelevant, who knows.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Either way, anyone arguing that &quot;most teams had four man rotations in the 1970s&quot; is misremembering, probably thanks to folks in the 1970s and 1980s misremembering themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6232" LastEditorUserId="6232" LastEditDate="2014-12-01T22:39:06.467" LastActivityDate="2014-12-01T22:39:06.467" CommentCount="11"/>
  
<row Id="7251" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="7221" CreationDate="2014-12-01T20:46:37.603" Score="-2" Body="&lt;p&gt;I am going to answer this with my coaching glasses on.  Mainly a football coach but have been involved, especially at high school level, with baseball team's conditioning programs.  Also was a decent pitcher in high school with a low 80s fastball.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I see three factors that have slowly increased rest needed for pitchers:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;added muscle.  Anecdotally I grew up playing baseball and I had a cannon.  As I got older (8-9) I started playing football.  Still good.  As I got a little older 14-15, started weight training - mainly legs/back but some arms/chest.  By 17 had elbow issues constantly throwing a baseball but football was fine.  I don't think weight training is the #1 issue but it contributes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;pitchers throw harder now.  The baseball world is whacko with radar guns.  It is FREAKING CRAZY and DUMB.  A high school kid who throws a gem shutout might have a bad outing to scouts because fastball topped off at 81 mph.  So guess what?  Kids know this, their coaches know this, their dads know this, their pitching coaches know this... So what happens?  They tweak their motion and throw as hard as they can all the time.  What do we get in the majors?  Yes, pitchers that throw as hard as the can all the time.  Very little emphasis on anything else until you hit the highest level.  What would they get if the kid that threw that shutout always got the scholarship?  More players that worried about spotting the ball, working hitters, throwing variety of speeds and pitches, and so on.  The cream doesn't always rise, because sometimes we throw out the cream.  (And I am saying this as a pitcher whose only trait was to throw hard)  Greg Maddux was one of the most dominant pitchers of the last 50 years and his fastball would be outdone by most college pitchers.  He also didn't have a fluke pitch (knuckleball).  Greg said that he could pitch every 3-4 days if needed - I don't think he pushed this since he loved golf (and one hell of a golfer).  Why aren't there more Maddux's?  Because those kids aren't getting college scholarships, scouts are not signing them and there is basically nothing you can do on your own.  A 22 year-old could get out 15 minor leaguers in a row in some fall ball league and no one would care unless he threw close to 90 or struck them all out.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;training, training, training.  It all starts at the youth level.  Most kids only pick up a baseball at practices.  They play video games for fun, not catch.  The fact that kids aren't out playing catch 5-7 days a week probably has a lot of long-term effects on their arm strength, ability to recover, flexibility and so on.  I personally pitched from 5 years-old on.  I can't ever remember my arm being sore until I started lifting.  We played catch every day, lots of long toss.  I pitched at least 3 games a week.  Basically I started every game and did the max innings (4 at the time) and would start the next game if league let you (leagues/tournaments only limited pitching limits so you couldn't ride one kid to a championship not because of injury risk).  Could the training be changed?  Yes.  But it would probably take a few years of development under new routine to see results and often young players aren't anywhere or even in the same organization for a few years.  A few major league teams have their own special sauce (Cardinals focus on a lot of long toss on off days) but they are fighting with &quot;stars&quot; who are making millions and already have their routine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My quick analysis - Teams could easily have their pitchers go every 3 days.  They would first need to limit their weight lifting that tightens or stresses the shoulder, chest, forearms, elbows.  I am not saying stop it but low impact stuff.  They would systemically train their players to almost throw every other day with even some throwing on off days.  But most importantly they would have to give up the radar gun mentality.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Will this ever change.  I can't see it now at the MLB level.  Pitchers are getting paid.  If they pitched 25% more they would want a raise.  Teams won't give them a raise until it works, players (players' agents) will fear extra pitching equals more injuries - which historically is incorrect, and then the two sides will go around in circles.  It would basically take one star to do this and win over his teammates, which may start another team trying the strategy.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6436" LastEditorUserId="6436" LastEditDate="2014-12-01T21:05:41.973" LastActivityDate="2014-12-01T21:05:41.973" CommentCount="0"/>

Chances are she doesn't grow at all and her fastball hits 75 mph max.  Many 13 year old girls are fully grown, height-wise.  I have personally been around 2 very athletic girls that were very similar to her - one as an umpire and another I personally coached.  The girls at 13 are just more mature than boys of that age psychologically and developmentally.  Boys hit their growing spurt around 14-15.  So girls have two years in school that they might be faster or more talented in the strength/speed sports.  [Actually 4 years ago one of my boys played against a 12 year old girl in football that was laying kids out.  She is talented and will probably have multiple big-time college offers for 2-3 sports but you would laugh if she had football pads on now.  She's 5-8 120 pounds... almost the same size as when she played football]&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want a disclaimer to my answer in that I am pretty strict what I consider a sport.  Auto racing, board games, and strategy games are not sports to me.  I personally feel that bowling is not a sport (but a great game) and golf is right on the lowest fringe of sport.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Do women have a chance?  Well not anytime soon.  They just don't have the physical attributes that will help them, unless they start altering their physical attributes.  I remember my college (large D1 school) having the WNBA players stay in the dorms over the summer.  I was on the basketball practice team.  Was probably at the level of a DIII starter but nothing great.  We would play the WNBA girls daily.  My team would include 1-2 guys from practice squade and 2-3 &quot;good&quot; pickup players. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In their three weeks there the WNBA players never won a game.  They scratched, clawed, brought out their 6-7 big, it didn't matter.  They couldn't stop our first step or the power drive.   Number don't lie.  We won probably close to 100 games.  Most of these girls were stars at big D1 programs.  We didn't hold back at all (mainly because they started playing dirty in game one) but we weren't also &quot;great&quot; players.  I believe all of the girls we played were better basketball players than us - fundamentals, shooting, tactic, positioning, whatever - but the athletic disadvantage was too much to make up.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What sport are women closest to catching men?

To do this they wouldn't necessarily have to be athletic or big.  They would need to perfect their craft of being a junk baller.  This would also obviously lead to other issues besides talent, but as John Kruk once said, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/John_Kruk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lady, I'm not an athlete.

This encapsulates most sports.  The possible niche being a sport where technique and practice can over take.  A good example is pitching in baseball.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;hr&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I stated in a comment on @Coach-D's post that I played NCAA baseball and we used to scrimmage the women basketball team at our school.  They had some players that were taller than our players, and they were more fundamentally sound than we were.  We would regularly beat them, and beat them easily.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thought that Mo'ne Davis could compete in the MLB with a normal skill set (by which I mean a fastball and two off-speed pitches) is absurd.  Unless she developed a devastating knuckle ball she wouldn't stand a chance.  This is purely physiological, females mature earlier than males and most likely we saw the best pure athlete that she will ever be.  Don't get me wrong she could refine mechanics and control, but the likelihood she throws over 85 MPH ever is slim.  If she were able to do that, then she would join the club of thousands of males in the minor leagues and independent leagues that can do so also.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;hr&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't not consider baseball a sport where you play the ball and not the man, as hitting versus a pitcher that throws in the 90's vs the 70's is a significant difference.

As many of the answers have said pitchers can condition their body and particularly their arm to throw on shorter rest. Current Major League relief pitchers are conditioned to throw on several concurrent days. However, they throw less pitches over a 5 day span than a starting pitcher. And as the original question pointed out starting pitchers can be successful on limited rest (Madison Bumgarner). But on average a starting pitcher would have a much shorter career if he pitch serval years with only 3 days rest between starts. Today Major League clubs are looking to preserve good pitcher into their late 30s, this would not be possible on 3 days rest between starts. More often that not pitching injuries are caused by fatigue. If pitchers threw more often on 3 days rest the chance of fatigue is more likely and therefore the chance for injury is more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I tried to find some research that would support my argument like Major League pitcher career length. But pitching career length is very short on average. I am familiar with the mechanics of throwing a baseball and it is a big stress on the small muscles, ligaments and tendons in the arm.

For instance if the runner missed first base and the pitcher stepped off and threw to third base the umpire would signal a &quot;safe&quot; sign.  The pitcher may appeal to every base after the play is over.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When is the play over?  This is a judgement call by the umpire but basically the rulebook states when a player has officially retreated from the play.  Meaning the player has begun to go to the dugout or is in the dugout or &quot;quit&quot; the play.  Note that this is not when the player hits homeplate or crosses home.  For instance a player could round the bases, cross home, run another 10 feet and a team could yell, &quot;Go back and hit first!&quot;  The player then would have the opportunity to hit home, then third, then second, then first, then second, then third and home again to complete their homerun.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It is crucial for the defensive team to not let on that they will appeal until the play is over and why you will notice that teams are very quiet/sneaky when they feel like something is missed.  The rulebook in my opinion gives the offensive player too much of a chance to correct their mistake.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The rule is that no run shall count with two outs if a player misses a bag and is out on appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Read reference from the book:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;APPROVED RULING: Two out, Jones on second, Smith on first and batter,&#10;  Brown, hits home run inside the park.

Another 49 of them were probably safety squeezes - ie, the runner on 3rd doesn't just run all out, but takes a big lead - so really 277/306 were successful, or some smaller amount of successes with same 29 failures (as some safety squeezes were also successful). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So, yes, the squeeze play is nearly always successful once the bunt is laid down.  It's not all that successful overall - it raises the Win Expectancy when correctly done, but not by a huge amount in most cases - but that's not really part of this question.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In terms of 'what the pitcher was thinking', part of it was probably that it is indeed hard to throw someone out on a squeeze.  Unless it's a safety squeeze, they guy is halfway down the line when the ball is bunted.  Think about it in terms of throwing out a guy stealing second - that's hard, right?  This is harder, because you have to pick up the ball and throw it from a worse position, AND the bunt takes a while anyway.  It's also relying on the catcher's positioning and your accurate throw, all of which are hard for a pitcher who's probably not all that practiced on defense.  It's also hard if he was a righty as he has to turn around to make the throw.  Not every pitcher is &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.mlb.com/video/v7282679/clecws-buehrles-backhand-flick-gets-the-runner&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mark Buehrle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Part of it is also, keep out of a big inning.  Guy on 3rd one out, for example, sure, you allow a run - but you prevent 2 or 3 if you don't get him out.  The run expectancy for 'guy on 3rd, one out' is 0.97; so getting the out and allowing the run to score is sort of 'default', a conservative play but not necessarily wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally, you don't say who it is, but it's spring training.  Is this a guy with a 80 on his back?  The really good players might try to make the play, but they also might not be all that interested in stretching for a spring training out.  The guys with 80s on their backs (ie, the guys who are trying to impress the major league staff but don't likely have jobs right now) are going to make the conservative play if they're smart, because it makes them look mature, like they understand how the game is played, and aren't overeager young'uns who try to make every out like it's the bottom of the 9th in the World Series.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, if it's actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/sports/baseball/07redsox.html?_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;in the 9th, tie game, in the playoffs&lt;/a&gt;, you can bet your life that he's throwing home... &lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6232" LastActivityDate="2015-03-30T03:32:58.860" CommentCount="3"/>

So the reason it is retracted if he pitches a 7th or 8th inning and gives up a 4th run is because the rule does not simply state if he pitches 6 innings and gives up no more than 3 runs in those 6 innings, he gets a quality start, anything after that is gravy.  It simply states that to qualify for a quality start, you must pitch at least 6 innings, meaning you still can't give up a 4th run after the 6 innings have been completed.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://joeposnanski.com/all-you-never-wanted-to-know-quality-starts/&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;An early criticism of the statistic, made by Moss Klein, writing in The Sporting News, is that a pitcher could conceivably meet the minimum requirements for a quality start and record a 4.50 ERA, seen as undesirable at the time. Bill James addressed this in his 1987 Baseball Abstract, saying the hypothetical example (a pitcher going exactly 6 innings and allowing exactly 3 runs) was extremely rare amongst starts recorded as quality starts, and that he doubted any pitchers had an ERA over 3.20 in their quality starts. This was later confirmed through computer analysis of all quality starts recorded from 1984 to 1991, which found that the average ERA in quality starts during that time period was 1.91.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start#cite_note-5&quot;&gt;Quality Start&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="8937" LastActivityDate="2015-05-06T15:47:43.207" CommentCount="1"/>

The comments on rule 7.8b say the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;A runner who is adjudged to have hindered a fielder who is attempting&#10;  to make a play on a batted ball is out whether it was intentional or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;If, however, the runner has contact with a legally occupied base when he hinders the fielder, he shall not be called out unless, in the umpire&#x2019;s judgment, such hindrance, whether it occurs on fair or foul territory, is intentional. If the umpire declares the hindrance intentional, the following penalty shall apply: With less than two out, the umpire shall declare both the runner and batter out. With two out, the umpire shall declare the batter out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if the ball was hit hard/fast enough that the player couldn't get out of the way, then it shouldn't be called intentional interference and the runner should be safe (if on a base). If the interference was intentional, then definitely out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rule 7.9j also says:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;It is interference by a batter or runner when -&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;(J)  He fails to avoid a fielder who is attempting to field a batted ball, or intentionally interferes with a thrown ball, provided that if two or more fielders attempt to field a batted ball, and the runner comes in contact with one or more of them, the umpire shall determine which fielder is entitled to the benefit of this rule, and shall not declare the runner out for coming in contact with a fielder other than the one the umpire determines to be entitled to field such a ball;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Again, the &quot;intentional interference with a thrown ball&quot; comes into play, just as in 7.8B. Rule 7.8 states the penalty for interference as: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;The runner is out and the ball is dead.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So, this guy probably would have been out under the rules had he picked up the ball, even though no-one else was on and there was no advantage to be gained from it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the ball is called dead (or time is called - effectively the same) anyone can touch the ball. You'll often see batters pick up a ball that was fouled straight down and drops right in front of the plate, or base coaches pick up balls and toss them to the crowd or ball boy/girl for slow hit balls that have been called foul. No penalty.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2014/official_baseball_rules.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2014/official_baseball_rules.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6049" LastActivityDate="2015-05-11T03:31:16.623" CommentCount="3"/>

There is also no obstruction because what would be the obstruction?  He is on a base - so he is safe to that bag.  And the fielder doesn't have a play so again there is nothing to obstruct.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There is no rule to reference because there aren't rules for non-infractions.  If I were umping the game and I thought the player was trying to help I would simply just yell and ask him not to touch the ball.  If I thought he was trying to be a smartass or cause a disruption then I warn him then kick him out the next time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is clearly a dead ball situation.  In baseball a dead ball situation isn't just timeouts.  It is when there is no advantage for either team (think when would an umpire call time on his own).  Even a player smacking a glove with a ball in it while standing on base and not trying to move to next base, that would be hard to argue as obstruction.  Unsportsmanlike conduct yes but obstruction no.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Did find an example in rulebook:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;ol&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;Offensive interference is an act by a member of the team at bat which interferes with, obstructs, impedes, hinders or confuses any&#10;  fielder attempting to make a play.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;Note that interference may be caused by any member of the offensive&#10;  team. A batter, runner, base coach, player in the dugout, or in the&#10;  bullpen.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;Note however, that the act of interference must be with a fielder&#10;  &quot;ATTEMPTING TO MAKE A PLAY.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since in your example there were no plays to be made... then no interference/obstruction.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Addendum:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;Rule 7.8:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;Any runner is out when:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;(B) He intentionally interferes with a thrown ball; or hinders a&#10;  fielder attempting to make a play on a batted ball &lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;A runner who is adjudged to have hindered a fielder who is attempting&#10;  to make a play on a batted ball is out whether it was intentional or&#10;  not.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note that all of the rules mention that the fielder must be making a PLAY.  There is no PLAY if a runner is already safe to a bag and a fielder is watching the ball roll around.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Please visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseball-rules.com/FAQs.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;baseball-rules.com&lt;/a&gt; for a full understanding - this is what I would send my new umps to when I chiefed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a side note:&lt;/strong&gt;  I have seen offensive players go grab a ball hundreds of times over the years.  I have never even thought about calling interference on them.  Most just do it instinctively because they would do it at a practice - and until you hit major league level you have spent much more time practicing than in games.  This type of play is very very common in junior, high school, and college baseball.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now if I am the defensive player if I am smart I act nonchalant and stick out my glove to ask for the ball.  When he puts ball in my glove or flips it to me, I then slap a tag on him as quick as possible.  I have seen this at least once (clear memory of one time in a game I umped and possibly more).  If the runner doesn't ask for time and flips the ball to player, it is a live ball.  It is still not interference or obstruction unless he was trying to take off to the next bag.  The defensive player can slap a tag on him during this ball shagging and the player can be called out.  Also as an umpire I would probably not grant a timeout to a player who has already stepped off the bag to shag a ball.  He is not in a neutral situation so I would make him return to bag before granting this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6436" LastEditorUserId="13485" LastEditDate="2018-04-02T11:07:11.113" LastActivityDate="2018-04-02T11:07:11.113" CommentCount="3"/>

He can be called out instantly (dead ball) even if the throw does not hit the runner, but the home plate umpire (who has the call, not the first base umpire) determines the throw was interfered with.

That means each batter typically has a 25% chance of getting a hit or 75% chance of getting out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;According to the same website, that same season teams averaged 1248 strikeouts.

For that we should talk about whiff%.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a commenter points out, it's very difficult to answer this in the general case as each pitcher is very different in how they get outs (some are strikeout pitchers, other are contact pitchers, some pitchers generate swinging strikes, others more called strikes). However, for the sake of the exercise, let's look at Tanaka. If we wanted to do, we could do another exercise and use league average swStr% from fangraphs and determine the likelihood for a league average hitter against a league average pitch, but that's less interesting I think and certainly much less likely than using someone like Tanaka who has a plus swing and miss pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, because it would be a very small sample, I'm going to ignore both count and game situation and assume all pitches are thrown in a vacuum. This is silly, but the numbers would quite quickly break down to small enough increments to be very unreliable. I'm also going to use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fangraphs.com/pitchfx.aspx?playerid=15764&amp;amp;position=P&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2014 numbers&lt;/a&gt; as it's a much larger sample than this year (and happens to be the year that you're looking for).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First of all, we need to figure out which pitch Tanaka was throwing, based the swing and miss numbers, I'm going to guess it was probably his Four Seam fastball. This pitch generated the most swings and misses for Tanaka last year. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Fangraphs, conveniently provides swinging strike numbers. As we've set up our experiment to &lt;em&gt;assume&lt;/em&gt; that swinging strikes are independent of each other (that's probably unlikely, but our numbers don't control or that, and if anything I'd believe this ends up coming out low). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tanaka's Four Seamer was very good last year. 27.4% of the time he threw it last year, he got a whiff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This means that the &lt;em&gt;expected&lt;/em&gt; numbers of swinging strikes in 6 Four Seam fastballs would only be 1.64. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, that's not what happened. Tanaka was particularly nasty and got 6 swinging strikes in a row. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The probability of an independent event happening 6 times in a row is the probability of the event to the power of the instances. Thus, in this case:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;.274^6 = .0000423 &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;or .00423%&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the odds of Tanaka throwing, and getting 6 strikes on the same pitch in a row is &lt;em&gt;somewhere around&lt;/em&gt; 4 thousandths of a percent. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6" LastActivityDate="2015-06-03T14:24:07.723" CommentCount="0"/>

Given that he's working on his normal throwing day, has gone through a full warmup and entered the game, he won't be available to throw much earlier than he would otherwise.  Even if he were, barring a double-header or something, you'd probably have to modify your existing rotation to re-use him.  Some other pitchers might not react well to that.  I'm sure there are &quot;ironmen&quot; that would be fine now and again with odd rotations, but it's not something that a club is going to plan for.  You use a pitcher normally and they get hurt, too bad.  You use a pitcher in a non-standard way and they get hurt, everyone is going to blame you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person you can replace him with is not one of your everyday starters, and may not be suited to going long into a game.  Your starter is valuable by consuming innings.  If the replacement starts giving up runs and you have to go deeper into the bullpen, you leave yourself in a poorer position for subsequent nights with tired relievers.  Except in an emergency/playoffs, you wouldn't put in another starter because they're not at the right point in the rotation and wouldn't be comfortable pitching that day.  (There are cases where you could use someone on their throwing day, but that's not common).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five runs (especially in the first inning) is not such a large lead.   Consider that the other pitchers might allow the other team to tie the game and it goes extra innings.  In this case, you want to have every pitcher possible available.  Throwing away a possible six or seven innings of available pitching for that day isn't a good idea if you plan for that possibility.  Don't think of it as an easy win, think of it as a chance for your ace to pitch effectively with less pressure than he would normally have.  Maybe you'll get eight innings and give the bullpen a day off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Players want to play.  A starter that's healthy wants to pitch on his day.  Taking him out with a big lead in the first means that a big chance for a win on his stats goes away.  Unless there's an injury, he's going to be very confused or offended to come out in that situation.  In the middle of the season, sometimes managing players is as important as managing the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't help whether you're at home or on the road.  The starting pitcher is already announced and already has gone through game-day warmups by the time this happens.  You still lose his services if you execute it before he faces a batter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="9578" LastActivityDate="2015-06-16T00:49:50.847" CommentCount="1"/>

There were runners on 2nd (Daniel Murphy) and 3rd (Ruben Tejada) and 1 out, and Tejada took off to steal home. About half-way between 3rd and home, Tejada turned around and got caught in a rundown. Meanwhile, Murphy took off from 2nd to 3rd, and stayed put on 3rd when he got there (expecting Tejada to get thrown out in the rundown). But the result of the rundown was that Tejada ran back to third, on which Murphy was still standing, and passed through the bag (believing he was out somehow), running &lt;em&gt;behind&lt;/em&gt; Murphy and proceeding to get tagged out. The Cubs player then tagged Murphy, standing on 3rd, and the third-base umpire ruled both men out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However the umpire quickly took back his ruling and went into conference with the other umpires, finally ruling only Tejada out, as he was tagged while behind 3rd base, but ruling Murphy safe at third.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My question is, should Murphy (the &lt;em&gt;following&lt;/em&gt; runner) have also been called out for &lt;em&gt;passing&lt;/em&gt; Tejada (the &lt;em&gt;preceding&lt;/em&gt; runner), when Tejada ran back through third base and behind Murphy before he (Tejada) was tagged out? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I suppose the issue comes down to the wording of the rule concerning runners passing other runners.

So total, he contributed 53% WPA to the Mets that game. Not bad for a Major League debut.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A couple of things to keep in mind about WPA. On the defense side, all of the value is attributed to the pitcher. So if a fielder makes a great play, the pitcher gets all of the credit. Also, it's all about context, so closers tend to have really high WPA values because they come into games that could go either way (~50% win expectancy), and if they close out the victory (100% win expectancy), the WPA will be ~50%. In a blowout, it's difficult to gain (or lose) WPA because the outcome of the game is largely determined already.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;See Fangraphs for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fangraphs.com/library/misc/wpa/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;good summary of WPA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="7548" LastActivityDate="2015-07-29T15:22:37.867" CommentCount="0"/>

They then changed teams three times in less than 10 years.  So - certainly it happens from time to time, and 30 years is a &quot;long&quot; time to have a single affiliation.  I would say it is a fairly common occurrence overall; most years it seems a couple of teams change at least.  My team (the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/affiliate.cgi?id=CHW&quot;&gt;White Sox&lt;/a&gt;) hasn't changed any of their main affiliates (Charlotte, Birmingham, Winston-Salem, Kannapolis) since 2001 , but who knows when that might change... and they change their rookie league teams pretty frequently (those are much higher turnover, from what I've seen).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6232" LastActivityDate="2015-08-06T16:23:28.647" CommentCount="0"/>

TZR is a system devised by Sean Smith with a brief description &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseball-reference.com/about/total_zone.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, which assigns hits by batters to position players based on the batted ball type and location. These have been reconstructed to a degree from historical play by play sources but the data becomes significantly more derived if only batted ball type and location of outs are available. So if you want to keep all things equal it is less fair to compare DWAR for players before 2003 with current stats, the further you go back the closer you will get to a point in which all of the stats are based on play by play data of varying quality.  To be fair box scores where of much greater quality in the early 20th century, compared with those from the 40's and on due to greater consumption of baseball over radio and more in depth written reviews. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't say there is a point at which there is an exponential decay, especially because the brilliant folks who worked on these analysis have gone through painstaking steps to go back through history and try to correct their methods when glaring errors become apparent. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On a side note Caught stealing data can be found to be variable depending on the source of the data especially for baserunner.

Changing arm slots can also lead to injury, especially for youth pitchers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even in MLB, it is pretty rare for a pitcher to intentionally change his arm slot from over-the-top or 3/4 to sidearm, but that is also because hitters would not be easily duped by it. In youth baseball, it could be effective, but better control is probably going to be more advantageous. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another issue that young players can encounter is getting into bad habits mechanically, such as a low release point. That can happen if the player spends a lot of time throwing tennis balls as they would throw baseballs, for example. The best way to teach good mechanics is to practice them and stick to them consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A common belief that is supported medically is that the elbow of the throwing arm should not deviate too far above or below the shoulder of the same arm. See the excerpt below based on studies by the American Sports Medicine Institute:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;There are many different &quot;arm slots&quot; at ball release. Some pitchers are more overhand, while others are more &quot;3/4 arm&quot; or sidearm. Regardless of the arm slot, the shoulder abduction angle should be about 90 degrees. In other words, different pitchers can have different tilts to their shoulder-to-shoulder line, but the throwing elbow should be approximately on the shoulder-to-shoulder line at the instant of ball release. Having the elbow far below or far above the shoulder line is dangerous for the tendons and ligaments in the shoulder joint.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.usabaseball.com/playball/coaches/resources/pitching/biomechanics-of-pitching/&quot;&gt;http://web.usabaseball.com/playball/coaches/resources/pitching/biomechanics-of-pitching/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="10532" LastActivityDate="2015-12-29T20:19:29.070" CommentCount="3"/>

In the bottom of the eighth inning, the seventh batter will be coming to the plate to lead off the inning.  As such, your new pitcher would now be batting third; that's not ideal, since he's not a very good batter, and so you'd need to either give up a free out, or pinch-hit for him.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Assuming this is a pitcher you want to pitch the top of the ninth - say, this is your closer, and you're up by a single run - you would rather move him up in the batting order, say to 6th.  That way he's unlikely to come to the plate in the eighth, at least unless you score a lot of runs (in which case you're probably fine with either result).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As such, you take out your left fielder, who is batting sixth, and replace the pitcher in that spot in the lineup, and a new (perhaps defensive-minded) left fielder in the 9th spot in the lineup.  Technically what you're doing is substituting the new pitcher for the old LF, and the new LF for the old pitcher; but it gets your batting lineup correct.  Now you have an at least somewhat competent bat up third the next inning, and your pitcher won't bat.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is covered in part in &lt;a href=&quot;http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2015/official_baseball_rules.pdf&quot;&gt;rule 5.10&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;If a double-switch is being made, the manager or coach shall first&#10;  notify the plate umpire.

They are looking at medical history, body type, and the players history. If a player is slight or has a lengthy injury history, they will be much more conservative with the number of pitches they allow him to throw in a game because throwing more puts you at greater injury risk.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As far as what it takes to add additional pitches to your endurance, getting into better shape might help, but most likely going through seasons injury free may allow you to increase your future load.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are numerous other factors that may change the number of pitches a pitcher is allowed to throw as well:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Types of situations a pitcher finds themselves in during the game. If a pitcher is &quot;cruising&quot; and does not throw a lot of pitches with base runners on base, they may be allowed more pitches because they may not be throwing max effort pitches because they don't have to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innings history. Young pitchers often have never had to pitch the 200+ innings a typical major league starter is asked to throw. Add to this that huge innings jumps season to season are tied to increased injury risk, and you often see young pitchers on innings limits early in their career. On a team with playoff aspirations(like the Mets), this can manifest itself via low pitch counts in early games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ineffectiveness late in games. It's well established that most pitchers are less effective their third time through a batting order and even less effective their fourth time through. Thus it's becoming more common for teams to pull starters after they've faced just 18 hitters (around 5-6 innings). This can lead to lower pitch counts and lower innings totals over the course of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So while the Mets (or reporters covering the Mets) may be using pitch count as a test, it's not the only one. However, if they are applying it, there are reasons they'd be doing so. The Mets young rotation is a significant asset to their team. It took them to the World Series last year and most of their young hurlers have three things that make them incredibly valuable: age (they're all quite young), talent (they're all quite good), and team control (they're all under contract for the next several years). Because they are such significant assets, it makes a great deal of sense for the Mets to take care of them in the most effective way possible. If they think that's by only allowing some of them to throw 80 pitches a game, then that's what they'll do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6" LastActivityDate="2016-03-06T04:57:34.150" CommentCount="0"/>

Personally, I hated breaking a glove in.  I felt as though breaking it in (even though it makes catching a lot easier) really broke down the fabric that makes the glove as special as it is.  I loved having a stiff glove because it didn't make the glove feel flimsy, but again that's personal preference.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to think about is the size of the player's glove.  As I am sure you know. Outfielder's gloves are supposed to be bigger than infielder's and pitchers due to them wanting to increase their range.  Same with infielder's and pitchers.  When I played infield I used 11 3/4 size glove but when I pitched I used a 11.5 and even 11.25 glove.  So in reference to your question, their breakpoint could be different due to the actual size of the glove, or the make of the glove, or the way they break it in (heat and oil, a lot of catch, etc).  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So really to answer your question, the way a glove is broke in is totally dependent on user preference.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="11009" LastActivityDate="2016-03-15T19:57:46.013" CommentCount="0"/>

At the age of 8, base runners aren't even allowed to take a lead, or even steal until the ball crosses home plate!  The timing, the mind-set, and the form is advanced for such young and developing players. And of course when I started coaching this kid and witnessed his stretch, the form was decent, but if you are going to start coaching a kid with pitching from the stretch I think they should at least be taught the correct methods. Such as not allowing the shoulders to move, stopping your glove after you are set, etc.. not a non-stop motion after coming to the set position.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, I have played with great players who don't use the wind-up either but again, they are far more advanced than an 8 year old player.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Can i get some explanation as to why this is preferred?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="11009" LastActivityDate="2017-04-25T14:31:11.700" Title="Why is the stretch preferred over the wind-up?"

It seems to me like the wind-up includes much of the stretch mechanics (roughly speaking) but with a lot of extra movements involved.  The fact that these kids don't have to actually worry about base runners should actually simplify things in learning the stretch delivery.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;From one article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ballfrogsports.com/blog/should-a-pitcher-learn-to-throw-from-the-windup-or-the-set-first/&quot;&gt;Ballfrog&lt;/a&gt; advocating for teaching the stretch to young players, &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;Professional ballplayers have honed their posture, balance, tempo, and timing for decades in many cases.  Kids have not had the benefit of this experience ....Pitching is complicated.  The mechanics of throwing a ball need to be in sync, and with many components to this motion, it can take time to learn.  Starting with the stretch introduces these complicated movements more slowly than does jumping straight into the windup.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They also suggest that injuries are reduced (fewer moving parts) and the wind-up can basically be added on after mastery of the stretch.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Former MLB pitcher Steven Ellis &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theulitmatepitcher.com/wind-up-vs-stretch/&quot;&gt;says:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;The only reason you lose velocity out of the stretch is because you have spent more time developing your wind-up mechanics. There must be a 50/50 split between practicing both pitching motions.&#10;  There are tons of MLB pitchers who strictly throw out of the stretch, and many of these pitchers throw above average velocity. In fact, many pitchers prefer throwing out of the stretch because it eliminates any unnecessary movement that could alter the progression of their mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So he's also saying that it's simpler and, interestingly, that the stretch isn't practiced enough.  I think the case could definitely be made then that for the long run it would be best to become very good at the stretch delivery and then, once the kid learns his balance and throwing technique, add the components of the wind-up to be proficient at both.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="9897" LastActivityDate="2016-03-18T16:19:51.693" CommentCount="2"/>

This, as a result, influenced specializing skills such as switch hitting and left-handed batting rather than by default (ie, clockwise baserunning, a mirror image of what we know today).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A few quotes from said article:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;Clockwise baserunning, therefore, would necessitate that most fielders&#10;  would have to turn before they threw the ball ... &#10;  Since a majority of the population would find it easier to throw&#10;  without first turning, and to swing the bat right-handed,&#10;  counterclockwise baserunning gradually prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;Now the environment of the game can influence skills that can be&#10;  learned. Professional baseball evolved with batters standing on either&#10;  side of the pitcher-catcher axis. ... The&#10;  left-handed batter stands closer to first base, and this provides his&#10;  team with an offensive advantage. He can both reach first more&#10;  quickly, and block the catcher's view of the runner on first.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;Baseball developed in a manner favoring the very specialized skill of&#10;  right-handed throwing, and the less-specialized technique of&#10;  left-handed hitting. Most ball-players at all positions throw&#10;  right-handed; many bat left-handed, however, and there have been very&#10;  few hitters indeed who bat right and throw left.

Functionally, a wood bat and aluminum bat serve the same purpose, however, as both you and akadian alluded to, there is a smaller sweet-spot on a wood bat, and you get a lot more &quot;real&quot; feedback, if you will. This trains the batter to work with a smaller margin of error, so when they are swinging their aluminum bat in a game, they are more likely to make good contact, even if they are a little early/late getting to the pitch, because they have trained to be more precise.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On an extreme level, many players also use some type of training bat that is much thinner than a normal bat (usually a shortened broom handle) and hit either ping pong balls or whiffle golf balls. It reduces the amount of physical exertion required to get hundreds of swings in per day, and trains an insane amount of hand-eye coordination. Speaking from experience, this exercise helps a LOT.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On a completely different note, however, there are also some practical reasons as well. One of these is keeping balls in the ballpark. All the way through high school (and to a lesser extent, college), there were 3-4 of us on my team that would consistently hit balls over the fence numerous times during batting practice. This caused lots of wasted time due to fence hopping and ball finding, and also diminished our supply of baseballs rather quickly. Using a wood bat helps keep a lot of balls in the park that would otherwise go out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The most important thing, however, is MECHANICS MECHANICS MECHANICS!!!!! If you do not maintain good mechanics throughout EVERY single swing you take, you will not get the results you are looking for. So, whether it is hitting with a wood bat, aluminum bat, or a broom handle, the underlying mechanics should never change. Ultimately, I never found switching up &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; I am hitting, or what I am hitting it &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; to be an issue when it came to game time.

Honestly, the reason is that most pitchers, biomechanically, have an arm slot that works for them to produce velocity, accuracy, and consistency. It is very common for pitchers to get to the major leagues with a certain arm slot, and have success, but for some reason either their pitching coach, or they themselves, will have the brilliant idea to change arm slots to &quot;create more movement&quot; or &quot;hide the ball better&quot;, etc. Unfortunately, however, at least from several pitchers I have seen, it has done more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some examples of this off the top of my head are:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Kevin Jepsen &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gammonsdaily.com/kevin-jepsens-new-arm-slot-productive-or-problematic/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.gammonsdaily.com/kevin-jepsens-new-arm-slot-productive-or-problematic/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ubaldo Jimenez &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.denverpost.com/ci_18113125&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.denverpost.com/ci_18113125&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thecutoffman.mlblogs.com/2013/04/18/can-ubaldo-jimenez-be-fixed/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://thecutoffman.mlblogs.com/2013/04/18/can-ubaldo-jimenez-be-fixed/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Jose Fernandez&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.topvelocity.net/jose-fernandezs-slider-may-have-ruined-his-arm/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.topvelocity.net/jose-fernandezs-slider-may-have-ruined-his-arm/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These are just a few examples to stir the pot, I am sure others will think of more, and also think of some examples who benefited tremendously from changing their arm slot. Consistency in mechanics &amp;amp; delivery is one of, if not the single most, important element in a successful pitcher. That being said, teaching a pitcher to change arm slots constantly can lead to inconsistency and injury.

Not frequently, but they do; I saw Jim Thome lay down a neat bunt several years back.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, the reason you don't see it all the time, is because the folks who the shift works against aren't trying to hit singles.  They're pull hitters (that's why the shift works), and they're pull hitters because that's the easiest way to hit a home run.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most &quot;full shift&quot; hitters are on the &quot;Three True Outcome&quot; spectrum; meaning, they're usually going to either strike out, walk, or hit a home run.  The really good ones - let's say someone like 2007 or 2009 Prince Fielder - are slugging .600+ (meaning their average trip to the plate, not counting walks, yields 0.6 bases).  Even the moderately okay ones are slugging .450-.500, meaning their average trip to the plate yields probably 0.5 or a bit more bases (if you add walks to the mix).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the question is, if they bunt away from the shift, will they stand on first base over half the time?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;hr&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I suspect the answer is no, unless they put in a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of practice.  Any practice going into bunting is coming out of their main purpose (slugging), so suggesting that they put in a substantial amount of practice is likely to be a non-starter.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Bunting is quite a bit harder than it looks.  Pitchers put in quite a few hours of practice per week on bunting, in the NL, and sacrifice bunts work okay, but not so frequently that I'd consider it easy.  You also have a very specific need here: bunting fair, but fairly close in down the third base line hard enough the pitcher can't easily field it (and of course the catcher can't either).  It's hard enough to sacrifice bunt (where the only requirement is that the ball go a few feet from the plate and not directly to the pitcher, with a runner who's got a lead and is probably faster on the basepaths); getting that bunt down is quite difficult.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even good bunters only get a bunt in fair territory around half the time; and of course some of those bunts are outs (ones too close to the pitcher or catcher, which go the wrong way, or are popped up).  So half the time, the first attempt will be a strike - meaning he won't have the surprise opportunity at that point.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would encourage you to read this Fangraphs article, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/the-truth-about-bunting/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Truth About Bunting&lt;/a&gt;.  They did significant work to analyze this exact question, and while they don't come to a concrete conclusion, the discussion might help you understand why you don't see it more.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6232" LastActivityDate="2016-05-11T16:24:11.577" CommentCount="0"/>

A dropped foul ball is just a foul ball. Anything happening after that plays out as it does. Errors only count if the hitter gets on base as a direct result of it (i.e. pops it up and the catcher drops it in fair territory and the batter reaches 1st because of it). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The best way to figure out unearned runs is to replay the inning without the errors. For instance, if batter 1 strikes out, batter 2 pops out to RF, batter 3 grounds it to SS and reaches because of a bad throw to 1st (an error on the SS), and then batter 4 hits a homerun.... replaying that inning without errors gives you a strike out, fly out, ground out (would have been if the throw were accurate). Therefore, the two runs scoring on the homerun were unearned. The hit still counts against the pitcher, so his final line for that inning is  1 IP, 1 H, 2 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I hope that helps. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="11591" LastActivityDate="2016-06-23T13:42:19.900" CommentCount="1"/>

Before, you had a starter that would just throw all 9 innings where now you have starters throwing 6 or 7 innings with a setup man leading to the closer. You also have situation guys like a lefty specialist that can come in to face lefties and more middle-relief guys working less than an inning. This shortened the games for starters because now they just have to try to be effective for those 7 innings instead of worrying about the 3rd and 4th times through the lineup. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Times have also shifted to be a lot more stat based, meaning more effective matchups for the bullpen and starters.

The first one regarding right-handed pitchers being better against right-handed batters, and vice-versa with lefties. The second is the situation itself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first thing to consider is kind of what @Larry mentioned with splits not actually holding true to that thinking. It more depends on the pitcher's pitch selection. For instance, cut fastballs actually break to inside of an opposite handed hitter. An example of this is Mariano Rivera (a righty), who had one of the best cutters in the game. He actually allowed a career .213 BA to right-handed hitters and a .206 BA to left-handed hitters (better against lefties) because his pitch broke that way. It more depends on the break of the pitches, which is why there are a lot of right-handers that are more effective against RH batters, and vice-versa. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The second part of this is the specific situation (I found the game so I could reference it). In the game, Worley started and lasted 6 innings, which meant that by the time Liz came in, the Pirates had already used 4 of their relief pitchers (he was #5). ML teams usually carry 12 or 13 pitchers, 5 of which are your starting rotation that will almost never see relief, which means you have 7 relief pitchers. This means they had 2 left in their bullpen in a 2-1 game that had already gone 12 innings. In extra inning games, you generally stretch pitchers out more than usual because you never know how long the game will go and you don't want to run out of pitchers. In that case, you're looking at a game in which one team had scored 1 run in 12 innings and the other team 2...scoring isn't coming easy, meaning that game could easily go 15+ innings. At that point, you have position players pitching, which furthers their risk of injury too. This is why you don't see a pitcher coming in during the 12th inning to face 1 batter. Generally, they try to get at least 2 innings from each pitcher. If Worley had lasted another inning or 2, you might have seen the change since it would have saved 2 pitchers for later. With him lasting only 6 though, your bullpen was already pressed into action earlier than normal.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="11591" LastActivityDate="2016-06-23T21:00:44.027" CommentCount="1"/>

Considering you can only throw 45 yds (135 ft. I am going to use ft. from now on because everything in baseball is measured in ft.) I can guess with almost 95% certainty that your issues are mechanical. 135 ft is only 8 ft. farther than home to second. If you are using a max-effort, crow-hop throw and cannot throw it out of the infield over second base from home plate, I have to believe that you have very inefficient energy transfer in your throwing mechanics. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that strength and build can factor in as well, but has its limitations. Assuming that you are a normal, healthy, high-school-aged athlete, though, I am going to say that strength is not the core of this issue. The other important thing to keep in mind is that a baseball only weighs 5 ounces. Therefore, strength has a rather low point of diminishing returns on velocity  (hence why there are no MLB pitchers that look like body builders). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;h3&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/h3&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Get video - Seeing yourself and being able to slow your mechanics down frame-by-frame is invaluable to identifying and visualizing where you are going wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Evaluate your mechanics - get a coach (online or in-person) that knows what they're doing. If your coach does not use video.. find a new coach. Losses in energy transfer happen in fractions of a second, I don't care how long you've been coaching, you cannot see that with the naked eye - not to mention, there are literally hundreds of things to look for.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IMPROVE YOUR FLEXIBILITY&lt;/em&gt; - This so often gets ignored. Probably because doing yoga sounds lame, but I promise you, flexibility is incredibly important for velocity. The more torque you can create with hip/shoulder separation, and the more external rotation you can get out of your arm, the faster and further the ball is going to travel. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Play long-toss at least 2 days per week - This trains your muscles for max-effort throwing. Also, different muscle groups are engaged when throwing long-toss (most similar to an outfield throw) than pitching off of a mound or throwing at normal distances. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Continue to grow &amp;amp; get stronger - Like I said, strength does factor in here, and you will definitely improve velocity/distance as you get older, stronger, and grow into your body. That being said, it should not be your #1 point of emphasis, because until your mechanics are solid, you will always get more gains out of improving mechanics over improving strength. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="10837" LastActivityDate="2016-06-27T21:27:57.270" CommentCount="0"/>

If a fielder, attempting a catch at the edge of the dugout, is&#10;  &#x201C;held up&#x201D; and kept from an apparent fall by a player or players of&#10;  either team and the catch is made, it shall be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a very specific comment but just speaks to the line between assist and interference on a play.  Also refer to Section 6.01(d) that is about Unintentional Interference.  Most oddball cases of interference concerning players or coaches (not fans - which there is a clear rule for) fall under Unintentional Interference.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So as an umpire we know that coaches/players can act as a wall by dugout steps - which the quote above clearly instructs.  But all umpires are instructed also that to use the Unintentional Interference rules to make decisions on things like this.  If there was &quot;help&quot; before they catch it, then we don't know if it would have been caught or not.  Therefore no catch.  But that is the umpire clearly saying there was &quot;help&quot;.  It is really a judgement decision.  I know that in MLB they are a lot more forgiving on this rule (maybe because players are worth a lot more) than they are in the college or high school games.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I personally have called a bunch of college games... I had one batted ball that went into the defenses dugout and players held him up - but beyond dugout stairs, and luckily for me he dropped it.  I would have had to take the catch away because they clearly gave the player another couple of feet in the air - not formed a wall.  Now if it was the opposing teams dugout as long as intent is good once you hit the dugout area even if their clumsiness caused the flyball I wouldn't label it interference unless it was intentional.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also note - and maybe a great trivia question because maybe one of those things that has never happened in MLB - that if the opposing team assists too much to help a fielder it is also Unintentional Interference and umpires if doing their job by the book should call the play dead with no catch.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6436" LastEditorUserId="6436" LastEditDate="2016-07-04T03:50:28.710" LastActivityDate="2016-07-04T03:50:28.710" CommentCount="3"/>

MLB hasn't changed it because: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLB doesn't like to make changes that effected past stats.  Which is just dumb because this literally hardly ever happens at the MLB level.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since it doesn't happen at the MLB level, no one gives a crap about it.  The first time someone won or lost a batting title based on a baserunning error ESPN would do a documentary and MLB would happily change the rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I did scorekeeping for a few high school teams my sons played on.  I told the coaches from the get go that I counted hits as hits, rules be damned.  Doing otherwise doesn't let the stats reflect what is going on, on the field.  Just like when giving out errors in baseball or assists in basketball it is about obeying the spirit of the rules.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men on first and second.  Batter lines a one hopper to the left and the shortstop dives and catches the ball. Notices that runner from first is already at second.  Runner that was on second was caught daydreaming and thought there was no one on first so decided not to try to advance.  He would have been safe by a mile but is out on force.  Why in the world would the batter have a &quot;FC&quot; on his score card.  My score card shows &quot;1B&quot; for batter and baserunning error and out for the kid forced out at third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Man on first.  Batter hits a hard line drive to left.  Runner was moving from the start.  Leftfielder was playing in and picks up the ball clean off one hop and fires to second base for the out.  That is a &quot;FC&quot;.  The batter caused the out.  Highly unlucky but that is his out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Man on first.  Batter hits a bloop well over third baseman's head.  Runner decides to tag when he should have been in the middle of first and second.  Leftfielder doesn't get to it but fires to second and beats runner by a step.  Again this is a hit &quot;1B&quot; and a baserunning error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now if someone is superbly slow... We had one player like that.  He literally took 7-8 seconds on a good day to get to second with a lead off (and he wasn't fat so it fascinating).  I charged him with 4 baserunning errors that year.  It simply isn't measuring the hitter when he keeps getting forced out at second from the outfield.  I kid you not one play the ball was batted between center and left and dumb &quot;Chad&quot; (yes he wasn't bright either) takes like 4 steps towards second then shifted his momentum back to first.  The centerfielder had to backtrack big time so the ball didn't pass him.  The batter probably had a 95%+ chance at a double and surely would have went for two.  Chad got nailed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion if you did this right you would set the right attribute to the right stat.  For instance a batter who hits a one hopper to the right fielder and trips on his way to first, that is really a 1B and baserunning error.  The at bat resulted in a &quot;hit&quot;.  The baserunning resulted in an out.  So in conclusion the rule is absurd.  If scorekeepers get to give a third basemen an error after he lays out for a ball but then bobbles it, well they can handle these obvious baserunning issues a few times a year.  How you score things is up to your league and if your league doesn't have rules it is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6436" LastActivityDate="2016-07-09T03:41:06.003" CommentCount="0"/>

If there is more than one appeal&#10;  during a play that ends a half-inning, the defense may elect to take&#10;  the out that gives it the advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the case an appeal is made on a force out (i.e. the batter-runner missed first base) and the appeal is upheld, the appeal takes precedence and the run would not count.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This case is a little more complicated. Given that the batter-runner may stop or slow running because of the tag on the player running from 2nd to 3rd, I would guess that the force out would not apply and the run would count. I am having some trouble finding definitive documentation on that. But, Rule 5.09e - Retiring The Side says:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;When three offensive players are legally put out, that team takes the&#10;  field and the opposing team becomes the offensive team.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me like the third out in your scenario would end the inning immediately and the batter-runner would no longer be required to touch first base. Wikipedia disagrees with me, but there is no citation for the specific scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If step 3 doesn't happen, then the run definitely counts. Third outs only negate a run if they are a force or happen before the runner crosses the plate.

The regulations could be different for different leagues.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A timer like you describe is usually for the benefit of broadcasters to have a specific amount of time to break for commercials.  The extra five seconds would let them rejoin after two minutes and not be in the middle of the first pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The umpire will hold the game to not start before the time is up.  Once done, the ump should control the pace of game as at any other point in an inning.  If the players aren't ready, he'll go and try to move them along.  There's no automatic penalty for not being ready.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now if the ump feels that someone is trying to delay the game intentionally, he can force things to happen, but that isn't usually necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In MLB, 5.07(c) specifies that when there are no runners on base, the pitcher should be delivering the pitch within 12 seconds of having the ball and being notified that it is in play.

The timing stops when the pitcher releases the&#10;  ball.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;The intent of this rule is to avoid unnecessary delays. The&#10;  umpire shall insist that the catcher return the ball promptly to the&#10;  pitcher, and that the pitcher take his position on the&#10;  rubber promptly. Obvious delay by the pitcher should instantly be&#10;  penalized by the umpire.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;5.04 (b) (4) (A) has the comment&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;If the batter intentionally leaves the batter&#x2019;s box and delays play,&#10;  and none of the exceptions listed in Rule 5.04(b)(4)(A)(i) through&#10;  (viii) applies, the umpire shall&#10;  issue a warning to the batter for the batter&#x2019;s first violation of this&#10;  Rule in a game.

As different as golf swings are (eg, Jim Furyk, Bubba Watson, Rory McIlroy), players are similar at different points of the golf swing, especially impact. The &quot;increase in swing radius&quot; is a minor benefit compared to consistently and reliably hitting a golf ball long and straight.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Having played a season of ASA slow-pitch softball, using the same swing as I do in golf isn't feasible. If you go into the batter's box (with your heels as close to the boundary as possible), face the plate, and reach your left arm straight, the handle of the bat (or, at best, the middle of the bat) will be over the strike zone. You want the barrel of the bat to hit the baseball.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yes, both swings use similar concepts (utilize the core, unwind, transfer to the arms), but both swings are used under different scenarios (reaction in baseball vs. stationary in golf) and for different locations (variably waist-high in baseball vs. constantly at your feet in golf). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;hr&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If Miguel Cabrera was hitting a golf ball or if Bubba Watson was hitting a baseball, it is evident that body position will be different as a result to adjust to where they need to make contact.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/xgp52.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/xgp52.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Miguel Cabrera&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/m87cR.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/m87cR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bubba Watson&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerDisplayName="user527" LastEditorDisplayName="user527" LastEditDate="2016-08-26T12:45:01.420" LastActivityDate="2016-08-26T12:45:01.420" CommentCount="3"/>

You must have watched pro golfers doing a practice swing before hitting the ball. The practice swing is necessary because they need to check the distance between the ball and their hands. The distance should be measured as exactly as possible so that such a small ball could be hit with a tiny sweet spot in a golf club. That's why golf players keep their left arms straight. You have to note that players don't keep their left arm straight when they play with shorter clubs for shorter distance. They keep their arms connected to the body. In other words, the longer distance you want to hit, the more straight you should keep your left arm.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In baseball, you swing your bat towards an incoming ball. If a pitched ball comes outside, you can keep your left arm straight trying to hit it with the barrel. If it comes far outside, you will most likely hit the ball with the cap (end of the bat). That's when you have the maximum distance between an incoming ball and your body with a bat.

The idea is that the purity of the batter versus pitcher matchup should not be tarnished (on either side - pitchers should not use spitballs or pine tar to alter the ball, batters should not rely on information given to them by others).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, in the modern day no-one would really complain about the simple versions of stealing signs - the runner at second base tipping the batter off.  They specifically use special signs to avoid that happening, and often switch them up mid-game or even mid-at bat.  What the complaints are typically, are that someone is either using technology (such as a hidden camera) or the old-school version of that, namely a person in the bleachers with a phone or similar.  That's considered cheating, since it involves people not in the game communicating information.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is something that's fairly well covered in the media.

That's slightly less than one in three at-bats resulting in a batted ball good enough to get the player on base without some error by the defending team. Additionally, out of however many pitches a batter will see in a season (let's say they see an average of five per at-bat, an average of 4 at-bats in a game, times 162 regular-season games, so somewhere in the neighborhood of 3,200 pitches per season), the home-run record is 73 in a regular season, and that guy admitted to steroid use.

The best baseball players can do is simply nowhere near good enough in terms of ball striking precision to even show up at the golf course. The golfer, on every shot, is expected to hit a ball 1.625&quot; in diameter using a club with a sweet spot about as big as the ball itself, on the end of a shaft that can be up to 6 inches longer than a baseball bat. Not only do they have to do that, but every shot is expected to be accurate to the level of Babe Ruth's famous called shot (within a section of bleachers), otherwise it's seen as a miss.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That is the level of precision professional golfers require just to end up with a par score, much less to find the extra 10-15 shots over 4 rounds of golf needed to win a tournament. Their technique, therefore, requires precision over power. A straight left arm keeps the swing closer to a single plane, and more importantly, brings the clubhead right back to where it was at address, which is the biggest aid to precision that a golfer can give himself.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="528" LastActivityDate="2016-10-10T20:50:01.120" CommentCount="1"/>

You would use it slightly differently from batting average, since it's measuring a different thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's see some examples.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;hr&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Player A has a .300 BA, .450 SLG, 1.5 SLG/BA ratio&#10;Player B has a .280 BA, .320 SLG, 1.1 SLG/BA ratio&#10;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;hr&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can use batting average to measure, for example, the probability that one of two players gets a hit in their next at-bat.  That would be &lt;code&gt;1-((1-.3)*(1-.28)) = 1-(.7*.72) = (.496)&lt;/code&gt;.  So these two players, on average, will get one hit between the two of them about half the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You cannot determine that with SLG, of course, as SLG does not measure proportion of at bats with hits.  SLG measures total bases, though, so you can use that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, in this case, you would say that the expected value of Player A's total bases after one at-bat is 0.450 (his SLG).  So, in an average at-bat Player A records 0.45 bases.  Player B, similarly, records 0.32 bases in an average at-bat.  This all assumes that it is an offical at-bat, and not a walk or similar, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you want to combine the two, then, you would &lt;em&gt;add&lt;/em&gt; the terms together.  You would say, &quot;The expected value of total bases after both Player A and Player B bat is 0.32+0.45 = 0.77&quot;, meaning after the two of them bat, on average 0.77 bases are recorded.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You could actually do this with batting averages, too, of course.  0.300 is also the expected value of the &quot;hit&quot; statistic after an at-bat.  So after the two players both bat, the expected value of &quot;hits&quot; for the team for those two at-bats is 0.3+0.28 = 0.58.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is fairly easy to see; you already calculated the joint probability of at least one hit (0.496), and the probability of both of them getting a hit is easy (0.3*0.28 = .084).  Sum those two together and you get 0.58 again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;hr&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing you can do with regards to conditional probability is combine batting average and slugging percentage.  Batting average says &quot;This is the probability of a hit&quot;, and Slugging percentage says &quot;This is the expected number of bases from hits&quot;, right?  So E(TB|H) is reasonable to calculate, and is simple (and this should be obvious):  SLG/BA.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So 0.45 is SLG for player A, and 0.30 is BA for player A, so E(TB|H) = 1.5.   Player B has a 1.1 SLG/BA ratio, so E(TB|H)=1.1.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What this means, though, is that you can use &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; figure to discuss the expectations between the two.  If you want to know the expected number of bases given that one of them gets a hit, for example, you would say&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;E(TB|H) = Sum( (E(TB|H)*E(H) for each player) / (Joint probability of E(H))&#10;        = (E1(TB|H)*E1(H) + E2(TB|H)*E2(H)) / (1-(1-E1(H))*(1-E2(H)))&#10;        = (1.5*0.3 + 1.1*0.28)/(0.496)&#10;        = 1.55&#10;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That is, when at least one of them gets a hit, the expected value of total bases is 1.55 from the two of them.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;SLG works well with other statistics, to some extent, this way; you can derive things like isolated power (ISO), which tells you what proportion of their slugging percentage comes from XBH explicitly.  You can't explicitly calculate the probability of an XBH from it, though, since the proportion of 2B|3B|HR can vary with identical SLG/AVGs.  (Take one HR and one Single, and make them 1 2B and 1 3B, for example; identical SLG and AVG for those two results.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6232" LastEditorUserId="6232" LastEditDate="2016-10-14T22:07:29.757" LastActivityDate="2016-10-14T22:07:29.757" CommentCount="0"/>

Can't really comment on why it's in the 7th inning and not earlier in the game. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;The origin of the seventh-inning stretch is much disputed, and it is difficult to certify any definite history.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;One claimant is Brother Jasper (Brennan) of Mary, F.S.C., the man credited with bringing baseball to Manhattan College in New York City. Being the Prefect of Discipline as well as the coach of the team, it fell to Brother Jasper to supervise the student fans at every home game. On one particularly hot and muggy day in June 1882, during the seventh inning against a semi-pro team called the Metropolitans, the Prefect noticed his charges becoming restless. To break the tension, he called a timeout in the game and instructed everyone in the bleachers to stand up and unwind. It worked so well he began calling for a seventh-inning rest period at every game. The Manhattan College custom spread to the major leagues after the New York Giants were charmed by it at an exhibition game.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;In June 1869 the New York Herald published a report on a game between the Cincinnati Red Stockings and the Brooklyn Eagles (home team): &quot;At the close of the long second inning, the laughable stand up and stretch was indulged in all round the field.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;Whether a stretch was observed nationwide is not known, but later in 1869 the Cincinnati Commercial reported on a game that was played on the West Coast between the Red Stockings and the Eagle Club of San Francisco: &quot;One thing noticeable in this game was a ten minutes' intermission at the end of the sixth inning &#x2013; a dodge to advertise and have the crowd patronize the bar.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;However, a letter written in 1869 by Harry Wright (1835&#x2013;1895), manager of the Cincinnati Red Stockings documented something very similar to a seventh-inning stretch, making the following observation about the Cincinnati fans' ballpark behavior: &quot;The spectators all arise between halves of the seventh inning, extend their legs and arms and sometimes walk about. In so doing they enjoy the relief afforded by relaxation from a long posture upon hard benches.&quot; Another tale holds that the stretch was invented by a manager stalling for time to warm up a relief pitcher.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;On October 18, 1889 Game 1 of the 1889 World Series saw a seventh-inning stretch after somebody yelled &quot;stretch for luck&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;A popular story for the origin of the seventh-inning stretch is that on April 14, 1910, on opening day, 6 ft 2 in (188 cm), 350-pound (160 kg), President William Howard Taft was sore from prolonged sitting at a game between the Washington Senators and the Philadelphia Athletics and stood up to stretch, causing the crowd to feel obligated to join their president in his gestures. This story is set at a far later date than the others, however, so he may only have given the presidential seal of approval to a longstanding tradition; the story that his physical problems forced him to stand up contradict this, but he might have just been waiting for the proper accepted time to relieve his pain; either way, he gave national publicity to the practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;As to the name, there appears to be no written record of the name &quot;seventh-inning stretch&quot; before 1920, which since at least the late 1870s was called the Lucky Seventh, indicating that the 7th inning was settled on for superstitious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there are many references to what may have started the ritual, but no real proof.  It's just something that people observe, but no real reason is known as to why exactly it started.  The tradition, at least now, is people sing &quot;Take Me out To The Ballgame&quot; during this 7th inning stretch.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;There is no certain date when the tradition began, but the practice gained exceptional notoriety from broadcaster Harry Caray. Caray would sing the song to himself in the broadcast booth during the stretch while a play-by-play announcer for the Chicago White Sox.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;After hearing him sing one day, White Sox owner Bill Veeck Jr., the famed baseball promoter, had Caray's microphone turned on so that the ballpark could hear him sing. When Caray moved into the Chicago Cubs broadcast booth, he continued the practice, sparking what has become a Cubs tradition by regularly leading the crowd in singing the song in every seventh-inning stretch.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="8937" LastEditorUserId="8937" LastEditDate="2016-11-03T13:21:25.627" LastActivityDate="2016-11-03T13:21:25.627" CommentCount="0"/>

King Kelly was notorious for bunting foul in order to wear down a pitcher and eventually get balls leading to a walk.  Back in those days, foul balls were not strikes.  The rules of baseball had to be changed because of this strategy.

In the winter of 1919&#x2013;1920, managers voted to partially ban the spitball, allowing each team to designate at most two pitchers who would be permitted to legally throw spitballs. Then, following the 1920 season, the spitball was banned leaguewide, except for existing spitballers who were grandfathered in and allowed to keep throwing the pitch legally until they retired.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first stage looks highly surprising, but somewhat fair.  It's a way to allow some spitballs in the game but not all spitballs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The second stage puzzles me.

If you were pre-1920 and threw spitballs before, you can throw them after.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If not, no more spitballs.  Meaning the last time a spitball was legally thrown was probably around 1935 given there was a younger spitballer in 1919.  Since then it has been banned.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean it wasn't thrown, it just means it wasn't thrown legally.  There have been a number of players that have made their careers on spitballs.  One of their key traits was the ability to throw it and not get caught.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are rules all over sports exactly like this.  For instance in baseball and hockey the playing with a helmet was not forced outright to vets who had played without.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As far as the spitball usefulness this is directly related to the spin rate of the ball.  With a substance that makes a ball slippery a player can achieve a much better spin rate.

Section 2.00 of the&#10;  Official Rules describes different types of interference:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;INTERFERENCE (a) Offensive interference is an act by the team at bat&#10;  which interferes with, &lt;strong&gt;obstructs, impedes, hinders or confuses&lt;/strong&gt; any&#10;  fielder attempting to make a play. If the umpire declares the batter,&#10;  batter-runner, or a runner out for interference, all other runners&#10;  shall return to the last base that was in the judgment of the umpire,&#10;  legally touched at the time of the interference, unless otherwise&#10;  provided by these rules. Rule 2.00 (Interference) Comment: In the&#10;  event the batter-runner has not reached first base, all runners shall&#10;  return to the base last occupied at the time of the pitch. (b)&#10;  Defensive interference is an act by a fielder which hinders or&#10;  prevents a batter from hitting a pitch. (c) Umpire's interference&#10;  occurs (1) When an umpire hinders, impedes or prevents a catcher's&#10;  throw attempting to prevent a stolen base, or (2) When a fair ball&#10;  touches an umpire on fair territory before passing a fielder. (d)&#10;  Spectator interference occurs when a spectator reaches out of the&#10;  stands, or goes on the playing field, and touches a live ball. On any&#10;  interference the ball is dead. The situation described under (b) is&#10;  known as catcher's interference. Interference is also explained in&#10;  detail in section 7.09 of the rules, in the chapter pertaining to the&#10;  runner. Penalties for interference are described in this section.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;A common case of interference occurs when a batted ball hits a&#10;  baserunner in fair territory.

In a nutshell, the options you listed are not the only possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The runner at third has to wait for the throw to be released by the catcher, or he/she risks the catcher not throwing to second and instead getting the lead runner in a rundown or tagged-out situation at third.  So, if the runner leaves early, you get a runner on second, no runner on third, and another out.  That's, objectively, worse than 1st and 3rd without the added out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So, let's say the runner waits for the throw, that gives them less of a jump for the run to home plate.  Sometimes the fielder covering 2nd base doesn't even try to tag the runner, and comes straight home with the throw, getting the runner out, with the same result as if the runner left early and got caught.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the catcher's throw is perfect, the tag for the out at second can be applied and the fielder can be up and throwing home in almost the same instant, then you have both players caught stealing, two more outs, and no one on base.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes (less common) the catcher even throws the ball on a low trajectory and the pitcher will intercept it if he sees the player at third breaking on the throw, much like a cut-off man with a throw from the outfield.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All of these scenarios have happened during regular play.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="12167" LastActivityDate="2017-04-24T15:02:55.373" CommentCount="1"/>

Just because a pro says it works for those he's come in contact with does not mean it's gospel truth. I bet I could find other pros who'd differ on the subject. It can be very subjective. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been in the game for 30 years and coaching for 20+. I've seen more young arms sore and in pain throwing from the stretch than I ever have with the wind up. People say there are too many &quot;moving parts&quot; to the wind-up, but I don't buy it. I count 5 steps. That's not a lot. Momentum is everything. The wind-up minimizes the use of the arm, therefore reduces the chances of a painful experience. Small, weak, kids have a hard time controlling from the stretch (you'd think that not true, but it is). At the very least, a modified wind-up alleviates that to a certain degree. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My thought is, the stretch can turn into using the &lt;em&gt;arm&lt;/em&gt; more. But the wind-up uses (or should use) more of the &lt;em&gt;legs&lt;/em&gt;, which, in turn, takes away the possibility of sore arms (which I will always try and avoid with all youth players I work with). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've watched young kid after kid try and muscle the ball to the plate by using the stretch. They might throw a few good pitches, but, for the most part, it's not consistent, especially with weaker arms. And &quot;Yes&quot; BK, the stretch is more used by relievers when trying to hold runners on base. I have yet to see an MLB starter (in today's game), pitch from the stretch without runners on base. I'm sure they are out there, but they are the exception, not the rule, by any stretch (pun intended).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was at practice yesterday and some guy (with no experience) was trying to reteach my 8 year old to pitch from the stretch. I guess he did ok, but when he saw a batter he threw (maybe) 2 strikes and the rest were all over the place. Which leads me to believe that just because it might look like an easier approach, does not necessarily mean it's going to work. Also, the raw talent of the child needs to come into play. The more talented, the easier it would be to teach that child virtually anything. For others, it's more of a chore. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When the child I'm speaking of went back to the wind-up, his velocity increased and he threw more strikes than during the stretch position. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, for me is, the wind-up may have a few more moving parts, but in the end I think it's better to teach that than it is to (potentially) teach a pitching style that have the potential to put more stress on a young arm. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="13267" LastActivityDate="2017-04-25T14:31:11.700" CommentCount="4"/>

From Rule 5.02, no player may be put out while the ball is dead. According to rule 5.12, the ball is not &quot;Live&quot; yet, since the pitcher had not taken his place on the plate with a new ball and the umpire didn't say &quot;Play&quot;. The batter &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; trying to return to the base while the ball was still dead. So I'd conclude that the requirements for 4.09(c)(4) were not met and the player should have been safe.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6049" LastActivityDate="2017-05-04T17:11:47.253" CommentCount="0"/>

The third baseman may not have been in position while the first baseman was.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first two points above combine to mean that when the pitcher gets the ball, the runner on second is much closer to third than the batter is to first. Thus, if he throws to third the runner may be safe anyway. Throwing to first is almost a guaranteed out - although the risk of a wild throw is higher, it's still pretty low for most infielders and pitchers. They practice this a lot. You'd also need a very fast runner to beat out a throw to first in most infield grounder situations.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For the third issue, if the third baseman was also charging the ball, then he would not have been in position to receive the throw at third and thus get the out. The first baseman would have been moving towards first as soon as the ball was hit and he recognized it wasn't coming his way, so he is going to be there, ready for the ball. The pitcher should check third if he has time, but if there's a fast runner or the ball was a slow roller, he may be concerned about missing both outs if the third baseman isn't there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course, without seeing the play, it's hard to know just how close the pitcher and third baseman were to third, but these would be the most obvious reasons I can think of for the play happening the way you describe.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="6049" LastEditorUserId="6049" LastEditDate="2017-05-11T19:28:01.347" LastActivityDate="2017-05-11T19:28:01.347" CommentCount="2"/>

They announce when and where exactly it will be made up with the announcement it is postponed. Early in the season, games are always finished, wither on an off day, or by creating a double header, where only part of the first game is played. Later in the season, if no suitable date can be found to finish the game, the game is called. If it is at the end of an inning, or half inning when the home team is ahead, the game will be cut short, and the leading team would get the win. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To answer your question, If it is in the middle of an inning and the visitors are ahead, they will either not call a weather suspension and finish the inning or use the score at the end of the previously completed inning.

Further, when they are penalized, it's usually only a 4-6 game suspension (of a 100+ game season). So my question is, given how &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; dangerous a pitcher's fastball is, why doesn't MLB punish pitchers harder for hitting the batter?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm aware that there are &lt;em&gt;&quot;unwritten rules of the game&quot;&lt;/em&gt;, but honestly I think that's just an incredibly terrible excuse for bad behavior. The batter is completely defenseless, and the argument can even be made that the batter can't even properly do his job as an offensive player, due to the psychological effect of thinking that he's gonna get dinged. Parallels can be drawn between this and the NBA's rule of &quot;allowing shooters to come down in their space&quot;. In the NBA, you can no longer contest a shot and move into the shooter's space, because doing this prevents them from coming down safely, and also prevents them from developing a psychological block (thinking that they're going to come down on someone's foot and twist their ankle when they go up to shoot). This leads to better shooting, better offense, and more entertainment for fans.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Though we can't always determine a pitcher's intention, shouldn't a reasonably hard suspension be enough to deter throwing at batters no matter what? If a pitcher knows he's gonna get a hefty suspension regardless of his intent, I feel like he'd be much more careful in his pitch placement.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I personally just feel like it would just be better for the game of baseball to leave out the intentional hitting of batters.

When the batter goes up, he assumes some risk of being hit with a ball. The NBA rule punishes blocking the landing zone of a shooter. That rule is enforceable because blocking a landing zone is always intentional. There's no other reason to do that than to interfere with the shooter. In baseball, the psychological block you mentioned for the shooter is already present. There is a good chance a batter will be hit with a ball, whether the pitcher has intent behind it or not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the MLB were to punish pitchers no matter intent, well, they already do that! The batter gets a free base. If the MLB increases the punishment too much, the batters will become incentivized to get hit.

Throws for right-handers are far more open and natural.&#10;  But the primary problem Distefano encountered was with plays at home. Because his glove was on his right hand, every accurate throw to the runner's side of the plate would have to be reached for backhanded, impeding a quick tag.

But it is too high if you are simply interested in the chance of seeing a game with at least one slam (since some games may have multiple slams).  Fortunately the first reference (Baseball Almanac) lists all games with multiple grand slams, so this can be checked.  For the 13 years in question, there were only 15 slams hit in a game that already had one.

For one thing, loose-fitting batting helmets stay on the heads of hitters because they&#x2019;re trained to keep their heads straight, and focused on the ball. Meanwhile, &#x201C;a pitchers head&#x2019;s moves pretty violently,&#x201D; Green says. Would a helmet even stay on a pitcher&#x2019;s head?  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;Even if you, say, attached a chin strap to the helmet to better fasten it, like a hockey helmet, or add padding and ear flaps to secure it on the head, Green thinks the extra weight could cause more problems. &#x201C;If you put a several-pound object on a pitcher&#x2019;s head, it could interfere with his biomechanics,&#x201D; Green says. The pitching motion is already prone to injury; if a helmet mucks with it, injuries could increase. &#x201C;It would be very hard to put helmets on pitchers, given today&#x2019;s technology&#x201D; says Green. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Other Sources: &lt;a href=&quot;http://nypost.com/2013/12/19/helmets-for-pitchers-coming-to-baseball/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;nypost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1386032-should-mlb-force-pitchers-to-wear-helmets-for-their-own-safety&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;bleacherreport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espn.in/mlb/story/_/id/14765775/mlb-players-association-work-together-develop-more-protective-pitching-hat&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;espn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.mlb.com/news/article/67239942/paul-hagen-pitchers-should-wear-the-padded-caps/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;mlb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportsgrid.com/real-sports/mlb/incoming-should-pitchers-be-made-to-wear-helmets-before-someone-gets-killed-at-one-time-they-did/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;sportsgrid&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="13485" LastEditorUserId="13485" LastEditDate="2017-08-06T17:27:13.703" LastActivityDate="2017-08-06T17:27:13.703" CommentCount="0"/>

It is generally expected (at least in the US) that the concept of running out the play includes touching the base even after the out is made.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;From a preparation standpoint, if you're running knowing that you're going to go all the way to first anyway, you don't have to stop and think about the play in front of you (and make a mistake with your interpretation).  Errors are rare on routine grounders in the major leagues, but they happen and if you're used to not bothering to touch the base on an out, you can start to anticipate the out.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't able to find a source, but I recall listening to a team reporter discussing a Japanese player that came to the US that was chastised for not running out a ground ball.

The point of this guy is to get your leadoff hitter into scoring position (2nd and 3rd base), whether it be by bunting him over or getting a base hit.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;h1&gt;3 - All Around&lt;/h1&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This guy should posses power, or at least high contact rate.

He should also posses some kind of OBP as to get on base, kind of start the order over.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;h1&gt;6 - RBI Guy&lt;/h1&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This guy, as with the 5th hitter, is there to protect the guys in front of him, and drive in runs.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;h1&gt;7/8/9 - Fielders&lt;/h1&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the AL, where you have the DH, these guys would be the guys who aren't really great at hitting, they're mostly in the lineup for their defensive prowess.  They can be good hitters, guys to get on base, or have some power, but generally teams keep their lesser hitters in the bottom.  In the NL, the 9th slot is generally used for the pitcher.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sabermetrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;h1&gt;1 - High OBP&lt;/h1&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This guy needs to have high OBP, speed or not.  This guy is simply meant to get on base so there will be someone to drive in.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;h1&gt;2 - Contact&lt;/h1&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One of your best hitters, usually high contact, and high OBP.  This guy is meant to drive in runs.  No more sacrificing, this guys intent is to score runs and limit outs.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;h1&gt;3 - 5th Best Hitter&lt;/h1&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This guy would bat 5th in the traditional lineup, has some power, some contact, ability to drive in runs, and ability to help protect the #4.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;h1&gt;4 - Power&lt;/h1&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is your power hitter, as in the traditional lineup, you want this guy cleaning up the bases.  You want this guy to hit your home runs, and score.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;h1&gt;5 - 4th Best&lt;/h1&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is your cleanup guy in the traditional lineup.  This is the guy who also has power, also has the ability to drive in runs.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;h1&gt;6/7 - 6th and 7th Best Hitters&lt;/h1&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;These are the guys, as with the traditional lineup, who are usually only in the lineup for their defensive prowess. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;h1&gt;8/9 - NL (Pitcher and 8th Best Hitter), AL (8th and 9th Best Hitter)&lt;/h1&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the NL, with the new sabermetric lineup, the 8 slot is generally the pitcher and the 9 slot is for your worst hitter.  Basically hoping they get on base for the leadoff guy to start driving in runs again.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basically the advantage to this lineup is to stop trading outs for runs.  This lineup is to maximize runs, and stop the thinking of &quot;small ball&quot;, meaning bunting, getting base hits, etc.  This is usually called the &quot;optimized&quot; lineup.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;:  This isn't meant to be a one size fits all lineup explanation.

So there are no outs to be made on home plate or third (or on first).  They need to throw to second.  5.06(a)(2) tells us that the following runner (Adam in your example) would be out if tagged, if both Adam and Bert are on second.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;5.06(a)(2)  Two runners may not occupy a base, but if, while the ball is alive, two runners are touching a base, the following runner shall&#10;  be out when tagged and the preceding runner is entitled to the base,&#10;  unless Rule&#10;  5.06(b)(2) applies.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;5.06(b)(2) is for force situations and changes which runner would be out when tagged if two occupy a base.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="9578" LastActivityDate="2017-08-26T06:38:30.407" CommentCount="0"/>

If you were to add something to the formula (namely HBP numbers), you'd want to first look at how it affects the balance between 1. ease of use and 2. value of adding the new part.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this case, we already have a statistic that can be easily understood and calculated by any average fan.  Yes, an average fan &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be able to handle adding in the HBP but is that small burden worth it?  Just choosing a random league and year, I looked at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/2016-pitching-leaders.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;National League in 2016&lt;/a&gt; and Jimmy Nelson led the league by hitting 17 batters.  His actual WHIP of 1.517 would have been 1.612 if you include HBPs--a difference of about 1/10 of a point.  Keep in mind that that's the &lt;strong&gt;biggest&lt;/strong&gt; effect you would have seen for that year in that league.  Also, practically every pitcher would have a slightly higher WHIP, just not by 1/10 of a point.  For a &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt; stat like WHIP is intended to be, there's probably not enough value in adding the HBP numbers to be worth the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, you're right that HBP is often a controllable thing and there are plenty of advanced stats that do take it into account, for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fangraphs.com/library/pitching/fip/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Field Independent Pitching&lt;/a&gt;.

The only benefactor would be the runner at second base who will know when to steal a base. But he should be able to see the catcher's signs directly and wouldn't need a relay chain.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course, that runner could alert the batter directly on what pitch to expect once the signs have been cracked.

The signs indicate what kind of pitch (fastball, change-up, slider, curve, etc.) and often the placement - down the middle, inside. low/high, etc.  If you know that a batter has a hittable pitch and can relay that to them before the ball comes it greatly improves their chances at getting a hit and avoiding pitches that are likely to result in a swing and a miss.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Certainly a runner at 2nd base would have the best view of the catcher to see what signs issued, but the team at bat also has coaches at first and third bases who both have a pretty good view of the catcher.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But the real way this is being done today is through the use of the live television feed which teams use for instant replay on their jumbotron screens throughout the park.  Tom Verducci writing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.com/mlb/2017/09/05/yankees-red-sox-sign-stealing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for Sports Illustrated, says that use of the live feed became an issue when Major League Baseball instituted instant replay to review some calls in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It is common practice in baseball to steal signs and not technically against the rules.  One reason you see players come out to surround a pitcher is that the team changes signs during a game.  Where the Red Sox broke an actual rule, and not just ethics, was in the use of electronic equipment in the dugout.  The only communication device in a baseball dugout that uses electricity is supposed to be the analog phone that is connected to the bullpen.  Unlike most sports that have headsets, tablets, etc. baseball opts for the tradition of the past and says you cannot use any electronic communications in the dugout - so no one even has a cell phone. They do allow tablets, but they cannot receive information during the game - all data is preloaded (batter spray charts, pitcher tendencies, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Red Sox had someone who watched the video monitor in real time to get the sign and sent sign to a coach with an Apple Watch who could whistle to indicate either a pitch that they could hit or to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An old adage in baseball is, &quot;If you ain't cheatin' you ain't tryin'.&quot;  Sign stealing, baseball hiding, ball altering are accepted common practices, but if you are found with a nail file or use electronic means, etc. and get caught you are penalized. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="13922" LastActivityDate="2017-09-08T17:10:35.040" CommentCount="0"/>

While in men's world cups it's kinda rare to outscore a team by 5-6 goals it's even likely for the women to outscore an opponent by 10 goals. In competitions with more equal teams you won't see that many goals anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The following chart shows the difference of goals per match for the German Bundesliga. Last year the men even scored more, while the female teams' performance difference was on an equal level (Thanks to the Hamburger SV taking beatings regularly). Unlike the men's league the women's league always has one or two teams getting beat up badly, thus increasing the statistics. (13/14 it was Sindelfingen with 4:123 goals, which led to the 3,95 goals per match)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/jleuol.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/jleuol.png&quot; alt=&quot;bundesliga men/women&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/193153/umfrage/durchschnittliche-anzahl-der-tore-pro-saison-in-der-herren-und-frauen-fussballbundesliga/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Graph source&lt;/a&gt; (German)]&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you look at handball you won't see a difference that big. This is because the teams are not that different. You still have the best regularly beating the not-so-good teams, but the difference between men and women is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example last year's record of goals per match from Germany:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;pre&gt;League  |  Men  |  Women&#10;  1       53.96    54.57&#10;  2       53.41    53.59&#10;  3       59.90    52.30&lt;/pre&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;[Results taken from &lt;a href=&quot;http://bundesligainfo.de/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (German)] &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So it's no general &quot;problem&quot; of the gender.

It would probably stem from the lack of young left handers and their youth coaches trying to utilize them in pitching roles or 1st base.

I don't believe that there is anything in the rules that prevents a base runner from running all the way out in to the outfield when going from first to second base (as long as they are not trying to evade a tag).  I believe that runners are only called for &quot;running out of the base line&quot; when they are trying to evade a tag.  And that the &quot;base line&quot; is the line that the runner creates when he runs from one base to another.  So for example - I don't believe that it is against the rules for a runner to start at first base then run out in to right field and then run to second base.  As soon as a fielder is making an attept to tag the runner that runner is now required to run in a direct line either back to first or continue on to second base.  And that is when they are not allowed to deviate more than 3 feet in either direction.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So with all of that said - I had a thought today.  When a baserunner is leading off of first base could that runner move off of the base in a direct line with the pitcher?  I know it would be sort of a disadvantage in terms of getting a lead towards second since the runner would be moving out towards the pitcher in to the infield grass.  But it would make picking the runner off virtually impossible.  Any throw from the pitcher back to first base would almost certainly hit the runner.  And the runner could always go back to first standing up which would almost always get in the way of the throw back to first.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know it would be odd to see a runner leading off of first and standing in the infield grass about 3 strides off of the bag.  But it would seem like you could almost guarantee that you wouldn't get picked off.  And any attempt by the pitcher to throw over to first would be very risky and probably end up with a throw that hits off of the runner.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?

But the main reason is to look at them viciously, while thinking in their mind that they will get them next time.  Watch the best baseball movie of all, Bull Durham, and see what Kevin Costner is saying as he stares at the pitcher after he struck out.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;" OwnerUserId="15304" LastActivityDate="2018-05-11T03:05:45.760" CommentCount="0"/>
